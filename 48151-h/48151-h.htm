<p class="newpage p4 dedication">“Were I to pray for a taste which should stand me in stead under every
variety of circumstances, and be a source of happiness and cheerfulness to
me during life, and a shield against its ills, however things might go amiss
and the world frown upon me, it would be a taste for reading.... Give a
man this taste, and the means of gratifying it, and you can hardly fail of
making him a happy man; unless, indeed, you put into his hands a most
perverse selection of books. You place him in contact with the best society
in every period of history,&mdash;with the wisest, the wittiest, the tenderest, the
bravest, and the purest characters who have adorned humanity. You make
him a denizen of all nations, a contemporary of all ages. The world has
been created for him.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sir John Herschel.</span> <i>Address on the opening of

<h2>ADVERTISEMENT.</h2>

<p>In revising Beckmann’s celebrated Work, we have endeavoured
to improve it principally by altering such names, characters,
descriptions, and opinions as have become obsolete, or are
now known to be erroneous; and by such additions as seemed
necessary to bring the accounts of the subjects treated of to
the present state of knowledge. In some cases, these additions
may appear to diverge from the declared object of the work;
but in this we have only followed the example of Beckmann
himself, who frequently deviates from a strict historical path,
and we think advantageously, for the purpose of introducing
curious, instructive, or amusing information. In most cases,
where the subject under consideration is a process of manufacture,
we have given a brief outline of its practice or theory,
unless this had previously been done by the author. The translation,
also, has been carefully compared with the German, but
in only a very few cases could we detect errors which rendered
the passages contradictory or unintelligible: on the whole, it is
extremely well executed; and too much praise cannot be given
to Johnston, for the judicious manner in which he has embodied
in one article, detached essays on the same subject, which Beckmann<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
published at different periods, as he acquired fresh information.
The only instances in which this had been omitted,
are the articles on <a href="#turf"><i>Turf</i></a>, <a href="#cork"><i>Cork</i></a>, and <a href="#quarantine"><i>Quarantine</i></a>, which were
still encumbered with addenda; in the present edition, these have
been incorporated. All such quotations from Latin and Greek
authors, as might be deemed essential to the understanding of
the text, have been given in English; those of a mere critical
and philological character, it has been thought advisable to
leave untranslated. The book may be classed as a compound
of learned research and light reading, suitable both to the
popular reader and the scholar; and that character has been
preserved in the present edition. To the kindness of John
Frodsham, Esq., the present proprietor of Arnold’s Chronometer
Establishment, we are indebted for much of the interesting
information added to the article on ‘<a href="#clocks">Clocks and Watches</a>;’
and we have also to return our thanks to the publisher, Mr.
H. G. Bohn, for the assistance he has constantly afforded us,
as well as for his <a href="#memoir">Memoir of the author</a>.</p>

<h2>TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE.</h2>

<p>That the arts had their rise in the East, and that they were
conveyed thence to the Greeks, and from them to the Romans,
is universally admitted. Respecting the inventions and discoveries
however of the earliest ages, nothing certain is known.
Many of those most useful in common life must have been
the production of periods when men were little acquainted
with letters, or any sure mode of transmitting an account of
their improvements to succeeding generations. The taste
which then prevailed of giving to every thing a divine origin,
rendered traditional accounts fabulous; and the exaggeration
of poets tended more and more to make such authorities less
worthy of credit. A variety of works also, which might have
supplied us with information on this subject, have been lost;
and the relations of some of those preserved are so corrupted
and obscure, that the best commentators have not been able
to illustrate them. This in particular is the case with many
passages in Pliny, an author who appears to have collected
with the utmost diligence whatever he thought useful or curious,
and whose desire of communicating knowledge seems to
have been equal to his thirst for acquiring it.</p>

<p>Of all those nations whose history has been preserved, the
most distinguished are certainly the Greeks and the Romans;
but, as far as can be judged at this remote period, the former
were superior to the latter in point of invention. The Romans
indeed seem to have known little, except what they borrowed
from the Grecians; and it is evident, by their sending their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">x</a></span>
young men of rank to finish their education in Greece, that
they considered that country as the seat of the arts and the
sciences, and as a school where genius would be excited by
the finest models, while the taste was corrected and formed.
From some hints given however by Pliny and other writers,
we have reason to conclude that the Romans possessed more
knowledge of the arts than the moderns perhaps are willing
to allow, and that some inventions, considered as new, may be
only old ones revived and again rendered useful.</p>

<p>When Rome, abandoned to luxury and vice, became an
easy prey to those hordes of barbarians who overran the empire,
her arts shared in the general wreck, and were either
entirely lost, or for a time forgotten. The deplorable state of
ignorance in which Europe was afterwards plunged during
several centuries, retarded their revival; and it was not till a
late period, when favoured and protected by a few men of
superior genius, that they began to be again cultivated. It
cannot however be denied, that several important discoveries,
altogether unknown to the ancients, which must have had
considerable influence on the general state of society, were
made in ages that can hardly be exempted from the appellation
of barbarous. As a proof of this may be mentioned the
invention of <span class="locked">paper<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></span>, painting in <span class="locked">oil<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></span>, the mariner’s <span class="locked">compass<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></span>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">xi</a></span>
<span class="locked">gunpowder<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></span>, <span class="locked">printing<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></span>, and engraving on <span class="locked">copper<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></span>. After
the invention of the compass and printing, two grand sources<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">xii</a></span>
were opened for the improvement of science. In proportion as
navigation was extended, new objects were discovered to awaken
the curiosity and excite the attention of the learned; and the
ready means of diffusing knowledge, afforded by the press,
enabled the ingenious to make them publicly known. Ignorance
and superstition, the formidable enemies of philosophy
in every age, began soon to lose some of that power which
they had usurped; and states, forgetting their former blind
policy, adopted improvements which their prejudice had before
condemned.</p>

<p>Though it might be expected that the great share which
new inventions and discoveries have at all times had in effecting
such happy changes among mankind would have secured
them a distinguished place in the annals of nations, we find
with regret, that the pen of history has been more employed
in recording the crimes of ambition and the ravage of conquerors,
than in preserving the remembrance of those who, by
improving science and the arts, contributed to increase the
conveniences of life, and to heighten its enjoyments. So
little indeed has hitherto been done towards a history of inventions
and discoveries, that the rise and progress of part of
those even of modern times is involved in considerable darkness
and obscurity: of some the names of the inventors are
not so much as known, and the honour of others is disputed
by different nations; while the evidences on both sides are so
imperfect, that it is almost impossible to determine to which
the palm is due. To Professor Beckmann, therefore, those
fond of such researches are much indebted for the pains he
has been at to collect information on this subject; and though
he has perhaps not been able to clear up every doubt respecting
the objects on which he treats, he has certainly thrown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">xiii</a></span>
much light on many curious circumstances hitherto buried in
oblivion.</p>

<p>The author, with much modesty, gives to this work in the
original the title of only Collections towards a History of Inventions:
but as he has carefully traced out the rise and progress
of all those objects which form the subject of his inquiry,
from the earliest periods of their being known, as far
as books supplied information, and arranged his matter in
chronological order, the original title may admit, without
being liable to much criticism, of the small variation adopted
in the translation. The author, indeed, has not in these
volumes comprehended every invention and discovery, but he
has given an account of a great many, most of them very important.</p>

<p>Should any one be disposed to find fault with the author
for introducing into his work some articles which on the first
view may appear trifling, his own words, taken from the short
preface prefixed to the first volume of the original, will perhaps
be considered as a better exculpation than anything the
translator might advance in his favour. “I am sensible,” says
he, “that many here will find circumstances which they may
think unworthy of the labour I have bestowed upon them;
but those who know how different our judgements are respecting
utility, will not make theirs a rule for mine. Those whose
self-conceit would never allow them to be sensible of this truth,
and who reject as useless all ore in which they do not observe
pure gold, as they display very little acuteness, must be often
duped by the tinsel glare of false metal; and they give me as
little uneasiness as those who have no desire to know the
origin of inventions, or how they were brought to their present
utility. If my extending the term Invention farther than
is perhaps usual, by comprehending under it several police-establishments,
be a fault, it is at any rate harmless, and on
that account may be pardoned without much apology.”</p>

we can believe an Arabian author, who wrote in the thirteenth century,

authors, quoted by Casiri and Abulfeda, the Arabs found a manufactory of
paper at Samarcand in Bucharia, when they conquered that country in the
year of the Hegira 85, or of our æra 704. The art of making paper from

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="memoir">MEMOIR OF THE AUTHOR.</h2>

<p>John Beckmann, Professor of Œconomy at Göttingen during
a period of forty-five years, was born at Hoye, a small town
in the kingdom of Hanover, in 1739. His father held the appointment
of postmaster and receiver of taxes in that place,
and at the same time cultivated a small farm, which appears
to have inspired his son with a taste for agricultural pursuits.
The superintendence of his education devolved principally on
his mother, a woman of great prudence and strength of mind,
who was left a widow when young Beckmann was scarcely
seven years old. In a lonely house, amid examples of industry
and daily labour, he passed his youth in the perusal of works,
which, although of a common-place description, were not
without their use, as they led him to contract a methodical
habit of mind, and afforded considerable information on various
subjects, which in the sequel greatly assisted him in the
pursuits to which he owed his celebrity. He himself relates
that, when quite a boy, he was in the habit of making extracts
of all the striking passages he met with in the course of his
reading, by which means he acquired a ready use of the pen.
The insufficient circumstances of his family prevented his
education being cultivated in the schools till nearly fifteen; at
which age he was sent to the Gymnasium of Stade, then under
the direction of Gehlen, where in a short time he highly distinguished
himself in classical literature. Intended for the
clerical profession, he entered the university of Göttingen in
1759, for the purpose of completing his theological studies;
but whether the advice of Hollmann (afterwards his father-in-law),
with whom he had formed a close intimacy, produced a
change in his plans, or that the mathematical instructions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">xvi</a></span>
Professors Kaestner and Mayer were more congenial to his
mind than divinity, he abandoned the career marked out for
him, and devoted himself to the natural sciences and their
application, as well as to mathematics; whilst he cultivated
philology with such zeal, that he ultimately made himself
master of ten different languages. In order to gain greater
proficiency in these pursuits, he made a journey in 1762 to
the Netherlands, but returned to Hoye in the following year,
in consequence of the serious indisposition of his mother, who
dying shortly afterwards, left him destitute of guidance, and
in the greatest anxiety respecting his future prospects. At
this juncture Büsching advised him to travel to St. Petersburg,
where, upon the strong recommendations with which he was
provided, he was speedily appointed to the chair of Natural
Philosophy. Shortly after, Büsching, quitting the institution,
returned to Germany, and dissensions having arisen among
the directors, Beckmann likewise resigned his office. He then
proceeded to Sweden, with the view of acquiring a detailed
knowledge of the working of the mines in that country; making
his principal sojourn at Upsal, where he became acquainted
with Linnæus, and enjoyed the friendship and hospitality, as
well as the instructions, of that eminent <span class="locked">naturalist<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></span>. Leaving
Sweden, he directed his course to Denmark, visiting Copenhagen
and other towns, where he examined the various museums,
libraries and manufacturing establishments. On arriving
at Altona, he found there his friend Büsching, who
recommended him to Münchhausen, curator of the Academy
of Göttingen. After paying a visit to his brother at Marburgh,
he proceeded to Hanover; and being approved of by
Struve, then president of Göttingen under Münchhausen, he
was appointed, in 1766, Professor Extraordinary of Philosophy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">xvii</a></span>
to that university, of which he eventually became one of the
brightest ornaments.</p>

<p>His lectures upon œconomy had the recommendation of
novelty, and produced so much applause, that in 1770 he was
made ordinary professor of that science. They were attended
by the flower of the studious youth of all countries, Göttingen
being at that period one of the most popular universities in Europe;
and many even of the distinguished statesmen and public
functionaries of Germany did not disdain to be ranked among
his auditors. He was in the habit of accompanying them himself
into the workshops, to give them a practical knowledge of
the different processes and handicrafts of which he had explained
the theory. Once a week, also, he held a <i>Practicum
Camerale</i>, a scientific meeting, at which he explained subjects
of œconomy, administration, and finance, illustrating them
by readings from a great variety of sources. He composed,
to serve as a guide in this course of instruction, treatises on
rural œconomy, policy, finance, commerce, and other departments
of knowledge; which, though since carried to a
higher degree of perfection, owed to Beckmann their first
systematic form. He never entirely relinquished these public
lectures, but insensibly his private studies took a direction
altogether historical, the motives for which it may not be uninteresting
to point out.</p>

<p>It is indispensably requisite at Göttingen that every professor
should be able to give account of the progress and
existing state of the science to which he is appointed. Any
one, who two years after the publication of a work of importance
in his department should not have read and analysed
it, with a view of enriching his own observations, would
not be regarded as a worthy successor to the chair of Haller,
of Mosheim, of Gessner and Michaelis. Beckmann, who had
studied at Göttingen at a time when the example of these
great men dictated the law and gave the tone to the University,
and perhaps to the literature of Europe, was determined to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">xviii</a></span>
keep pace with the spirit of the age, and not to remain ignorant
of the great advances then making throughout Europe,
in the numerous sciences which furnished the subjects of his
practical investigations. But this was a task of no slight magnitude:
and indeed when the immense additions to so many
different sciences are considered, can it be wondered at, that,
notwithstanding his utmost zeal and application, he found it
impossible to read up all the important works which had appeared
since 1770, in chemistry, physics, natural history and
mathematics? Despairing of success in so Herculean an undertaking,
he began to entertain feelings of aversion towards
what he deemed the innovations, which were then changing
the face and enlarging the scope of science. But his
course of lectures, turning principally on practical matters,
was not materially affected; he was, however, so fearful of
falling under the imputation of being behind the progress of the
age, that he devoted his mind, peculiarly fitted for this kind
of study, almost exclusively to the history of arts and trades;
employing in the illustration of his subjects, the materials to
which he had access in the very extensive library belonging to
the university; and it is to his consequent labours and researches
that we owe the “History of Inventions and Discoveries.” In
this work, Beckmann traces their first germs from the remotest
periods of antiquity, and following their gradual development,
exhibits the latest improvements among civilized nations
with almost unequalled acumen and ability. It abounds
with invaluable materials respecting the general history of the
origin and progress of the mechanic arts, which are so important
a branch in civilization; and what must give it an
additional value in the eyes of all who are unwilling to place
reliance on assertions unsupported by authority, or may be
anxious to investigate the subject more deeply, the most
scrupulous references to original authorities accompany each
article. Among the numerous other works of merit for which
we are indebted to the literary industry of Beckmann, are,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">xix</a></span>
“A History and Analysis of early Voyages and Travels,” a
highly interesting collection, which occupied the last years of
his life, and was left unfinished at the eighth number; elaborate
editions of “De Mirabilibus Auscultationibus,” attributed
to Aristotle, 1786; “Antigoni Carystii Historiæ Mirabiles,”
1791; and “Marbodi Liber de Gemmis,” 1799;
publications which required the rare combination of physical
knowledge with philological learning.</p>

<p>The Royal Society of Göttingen had, in the year 1772, admitted
him one of its members, and from that period to 1783
he continued to supply their proceedings with interesting memoirs
(all written in Latin), among which are the following:
“On the Reduction of Fossils to their original substances;”
“On the History of Alum;” “On the Sap of Madder;” “On
Meerschaum, from which are formed the heads for tobacco
pipes;” “On the History of Sugar,” &amp;c. After this period,
however, he declined participating any longer in the labours
of this learned body; owing, probably, to a change in the objects
of his own particular studies. In 1784 he was created
an aulic councillor of Hanover; in addition to which he was
elected member of the Imperial Academy of Naturalists, of
the Swedish Society of Science, of the Academies of Norway
and Mayence, of the Physiographical Society of Lund, and of
almost all the learned societies in Germany and the North of
Europe.</p>

<p>With a copious knowledge of the principal sciences, Beckmann
united extensive reading in the works of ancient and
modern writers, not only in reference to their immediate connection
with his main studies, but in respect also to their application
generally to every other branch. Convinced that
every professor ought, as much as possible, to have thoroughly
searched into all matters relating to the subject on which he
treats, he spared no expense in forming a most extensive, as
well as choice library; at the same time he did not fail to
avail himself of the rich intellectual stores contained in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">xx</a></span>
belonging to the university. His mind being wholly directed
to all that is practical in human knowledge, it was his especial
endeavour to bring it into systematic rules, based upon
fundamental principles. To him particularly is to be ascribed
the merit of having been the first to give to agriculture its
scientific form, and to have separated it more distinctly than
heretofore from the administrative and financial departments.
The number of pupils indebted to him for their education,
and who, eventually,&mdash;whether filling offices of state or following
his footsteps as professors,&mdash;brought into effect the principles
he had taught them, formed a very numerous body;
and whilst he was thus the means of considerably enlarging
the circle of academic subjects for the instruction of the
student, he contributed not a little towards the prosperity of
the university itself. His activity likewise as a writer was
as persevering as it was meritorious; he united an extensive
knowledge of nature, with a decided turn for applying it to
practical purposes; and he published several works in German,
which show this tendency of mind; among others,
“Principles of German Agriculture,” “Introduction to
Technology,” “Introduction to the Science of Commerce,”
&amp;c.</p>

<p>To assist his literary researches, he issued a periodical work
called “Physico-Œconomical Library,” in which quarterly
information was communicated respecting the newest works
connected with the arts, manufactures, and agriculture, giving
short extracts of whatever was valuable, instead of severe criticisms,
of which he did not approve. It was commenced in
1770, and continued, with some little interruption, until 1807,
forming 23 volumes.</p>

<p>Having said thus much respecting his abilities and genius,
we will in conclusion take a brief glance at his private character,
which, amiable and virtuous as it was, cannot fail to
command the world’s estimation. Honest and unpretending,
a lover of peace and justice, he lived quite retired, devoted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">xxi</a></span>
the conscientious performance of his duties; his candour, his
sincerity in friendship, his affability to the students, have been
celebrated with one accord by his coadjutors and auditors.
In the domestic relations of life, he presented an example of
the most exact system of order and œconomy, and enjoyed the
reputation of being one of the richest professors of the university;
which enabled him to exercise his ready benevolence
during a period of severe dearth and suffering. Among his
colleagues, Schlœtzer, the distinguished historian, with whom
in his youth he had become acquainted in Russia, was the
one with whom he maintained the most uninterrupted intimacy,
arising, no doubt, from the congeniality of their pursuits.
Few were better qualified than Schlœtzer to appreciate
the researches of Beckmann, as he had himself insisted with
so much force on the necessity of introducing into history a
simultaneous view of the influence exercised on social institutions
by the efforts of industry, and the rise and maturity of
domestic arts. Beckmann married the daughter of Hollmann,
his tutor and friend, with whom he enjoyed a long and uninterrupted
course of happiness; she survived him only a few
weeks, leaving a son and daughter who had arrived at years
of maturity. His decease took place on the 3rd of February,
1811, in the 72nd year of his age. His illustrious colleague,
Heyne, pronounced an eloquent eulogium on him before the
Academy, which was published in the Göttingen Transactions,
from which we subjoin a few extracts.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“O colleagues, if we indulge in deep sorrow at this new
diminution of our fraternity by the death of one of its seniors,
it must be forgiven, as consonant to our duty and piety, as
well as to the affections of human nature. Indeed, when his
death was announced, and when I afterwards beheld the mournful
pomp of his funeral, I was afflicted with the utmost grief.
Nor can this be wondered at, when it is borne in mind that
he was nearly of my own age, and next to me the eldest of
our Society; the habit, too, of friendly intercourse enjoyed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">xxii</a></span>
many years, has great influence in riveting the affections of
the mind.</p>

<p>“There is a narrative in Herodotus, concerning Psammenitus
king of Egypt, who was conquered by Cambyses king
of Persia. The city of Memphis being taken by storm, he
had fallen into the hands of Cambyses; who, enraged at the
vigorous defence he had encountered, commanded the royal
family to be brought forth and put to death. In the first
place, his daughter was paraded before him, with many maidens
of noble birth, clothed as slaves; and though the other parents
uttered piteous lamentations, yet Psammenitus kept his eyes
fixed on the ground: in like manner, when his sons, together
with two thousand of the principal youths, their necks bound
with ropes, with bridles in their mouths, were ignominiously
led to death, the king did not even utter a groan; but on
seeing an aged man approach, one of his old friends, who had
formerly partaken of the royal table, walking in the dress of
a mendicant, and imploring mercy through the different ranks
of the army, then indeed the king could restrain his emotions
no longer, but broke forth into the most bitter wailings. The
cause of this strange grief it would be foreign to our present
purpose to discuss; I only wish to draw this conclusion&mdash;that
the death of an old friend and companion was alone able
to subdue his mind, even after it had supported him against
the severest calamities. For the force of habit and friendly
intercourse is most powerful: we bring to recollection many
things which prey upon our feelings; they rush upon our
memory with one impetus, and swell the rising grief; we dwell
on early struggles, on proofs of mental power, and instances
of benevolence, which formerly we had passed unheeded.</p>

<p>“What is known favourably of the character of him who is
taken away from us, it is our pleasing duty to bring before you;
what is otherwise, if anything exist, it is not our province to
remember.</p>

<p>“The studies of Beckmann were applied to other branches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">xxiii</a></span>
of learning, quite distinct from those in which I am occupied:
but it was this very circumstance which cemented our acquaintance.
His conversations on scientific subjects could
not but prove profitable; especially as he blended them with
a feeling for ancient literature. I was accustomed to consult
him concerning subjects of nature and art, which I did not
sufficiently understand; and he sometimes referred to me respecting
philological matters, of which he wished to gain
further information. But the varied talents of this illustrious
man were wonderful: an unceasing desire to search into the
origin of arts and sciences, and the history and success of inventors,
was united with an insatiable thirst for general
knowledge and classical learning. He was incessantly in our
public library, eagerly investigating and comparing rare books
in pursuit of his object; seizing their hidden treasures, and
then contributing his booty to the mental improvement of the
million.”</p></blockquote>

<h2 id="italian">ITALIAN BOOK-KEEPING.</h2>

<p>Those who are acquainted with the Italian method of book-keeping
must allow that it is an ingenious invention, of great
utility to men in business, and that it has contributed to extend
commerce and to facilitate its operations. It requires no
less attention, care, and accuracy, than many works which are
styled learned: but it is undoubtedly true, that most mercantile
people, without knowing the foundation of the rules on
which they proceed, conduct their books in as mechanical a
manner as many of the literati do their writings.</p>

<p>The name, Italian book-keeping, <i>Doppia scrittura</i>, with
several words employed in this branch of science and still retained
in all languages, make it probable that it was invented
by the Italians; and that other nations borrowed it, as well as
various short methods of reckoning, from their mercantile
houses, at the time when all the East-India trade passed through
Italy.</p>

in his Historical and Chronological Deduction of the Origin of
<span class="locked">Commerce<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></span>, gives the following account: “In all probability,
this art of double-entry accounts had its rise, or at least its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
revival, amongst the mercantile cities of Italy: possibly it might
be first known at Venice, about the time that numeral algebra
was taught there; from the principles of which science double-entry,
or what we call merchants’ accounts, seems to have
been deduced. It is said that Lucas de Burgo, a friar, was
the first European author who published his algebraic work
at Venice, anno 1494.”</p>

<p>This author, who was one of the greatest mathematicians of
the fifteenth century, and who is supposed to be the first person
who acquired a knowledge of algebra from the writings
of the Arabians, was called Lucas Paciolus, e Burgo S. Sepulchri.
He was a Franciscan, and so surnamed from a town in
the duchy of Urbino, on the Florentine confines, called Burgo
S. <span class="locked">Sepulchro<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></span>.</p>

<p>Anderson tells <span class="locked">us<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></span>, that he had in his possession the oldest
book published in England in which any account is given of
the method of book-keeping by double-entry. It was printed
at London, in 1569, in folio. The author, whose name is
James Peele, says, in his preface, that he had instructed many
mercantile people in this art, which had been long practised
in other countries, though in England it was then undoubtedly
new. One may readily believe that Mr. Anderson was not
ignorant of the difference between the method of book-keeping
by single and that by double-entry; but he produces
nothing to induce us to believe that Peele taught the latter
and not the former; for what he says of debit and credit is
of no importance, as it may be applied also to the method by
single-entry.</p>

<p>Of this Peele no mention is made in Ames’s Typographical
Antiquities; but in that work (p. 410) there is an account of a
still older treatise of book-keeping, entitled A briefe instruction
and manner how to keepe bookes of accompts, after the
order of debitor and creditor, and as well for proper accompts,
partible, &amp;c. by three bookes, named the memoriall, journall,
and leager. Newly augmented and set forth by John Mellis
schole maister. London 1588, 12mo. Mellis, in his preface,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
says that he is only the re-publisher of this treatise, which was
before published at London in 1543 by a schoolmaster named
Hugh Oldcastle. From the above title, and particularly from
the three account books mentioned in it, I am inclined to believe
that this work contained the true principles of book-keeping
by double-entry.</p>

<p>The oldest German work on book-keeping by double-entry
with which I am at present acquainted, is one written by John
Gotlieb, and printed at Nuremberg, by Frederick Peypus, in
<span class="locked">1531<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></span>. The author in his preface calls himself a citizen of
Nuremberg, and says that he means to give to the public a
clear and intelligible method of book-keeping, such as was
never before printed. It appears, therefore, that he considered
his book as the first of the kind ever published in Germany.</p>

<p>It is worthy of remark, that even at the end of the sixteenth
century, the Italian method of book-keeping began to be applied
to finances and public accounts. In the works of the
celebrated Simon Stevin, published at Leyden in Dutch, and
the same year in Latin, we find a system of book-keeping, as
applied to finances, drawn up it appears for the use of Maurice
prince of Orange. To this treatise is prefixed, in Dutch and
Latin, a dedication to the duke of Sully, in which the author
says, that his reason for dedicating the work to Sully was because
the French had paid the greatest attention to improve
the method of keeping public accounts. The work begins
with a conversation, which took place between Stevin and
prince Maurice, respecting the application of book-keeping
to public accounts, and in which he explains to the prince the
principles of mercantile book-keeping. This conversation commences
with explaining the nature of debit and credit, and
the principal accounts. Then follow a short journal and ledger,
in which occur only the most common transactions; and
the whole concludes with an account of the other books necessary
for regular book-keeping, and of the manner of
balancing. Stevin expressly says, that prince Maurice, in the
year 1604, caused the treasury accounts to be made out after
the Italian method, by an experienced book-keeper, with the
best success; but how long this regulation continued I have
not been able to learn. Stevin supposes, in this system, three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
ministers, and three different accounts: a <i>quæstor</i>, who receives
the revenues of the domains; an <i>acceptor</i>, who receives
all the other revenues of the prince; and a <i>thesaurarius</i> (treasurer),
who has the care of the expenditure. All inferior
offices for receiving or disbursing are to send from their books
monthly extracts, which are to be doubly-entered in a principal
ledger; so that it may be seen at all times how much remains
in the hands of each receiver, and how much each has
to collect from the debtors. One cannot help admiring the
ingenuity of the Latin <span class="locked">translator<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></span>, who has found out, or at
least invented, words to express so many new terms unknown
to the ancient Romans. The learned reader may, perhaps, not
be displeased with the following specimen. Book-keeping is
called <i>apologistica</i> or <i>apologismus</i>; a book-keeper <i>apologista</i>;
the ledger <i>codex accepti expensique</i>; the cash-book <i>arcarii liber</i>;
the expense-book <i>impensarum liber</i>; the waste-book <i>liber
deletitius</i>; accounts are called <i>nomina</i>; stock account <i>sors</i>;
profit and loss account <i>lucri damnique ratiocinium</i>, <i>contentio</i>
or <i>sortium comparatio</i>; the final balance <i>epilogismus</i>; the
chamber of accounts, or counting-house, <i>logisterium</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the end of this work Stevin endeavours to show that the
Romans, or rather the Grecians (for the former knew scarcely
anything but what the latter had discovered), were in some
measure acquainted with book-keeping, and supports his conjecture
by quoting Cicero’s oration for Roscius. I confess
that the following passage in Pliny, <i>Fortunæ omnia expensa,
huic omnia feruntur accepta, et in tota ratione mortalium sola
utramque paginam facit</i><a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>, as well as the terms <i>tabulæ accepti
et expensi</i>; <i>nomina translata in tabulas</i>, seem to indicate that
the Romans entered debit and credit in their books on two
different pages; but it appears to me not yet proved, and improbable,
that they were acquainted with our scientific method
of book-keeping; with the mode of opening various accounts;
of comparing them together, and of bringing them to a final
balance. As bills of exchange and insurance were not known
in the commerce of the ancients, the business of merchants
was not so intricate and complex as to require such a variety
of books and accounts as is necessary in that of the moderns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
Klipstein is of opinion that attempts were made in France
to apply book-keeping, by double-entry, to the public accounts,
under Henry IV., afterwards under Colbert, and again in the
year 1716. That attempts were made, for this purpose, under
Henry IV., he concludes from a work entitled An Inquiry
into the Finances of France; but I do not know whether what
the author says be sufficient to support this opinion.</p>

<p>[The system of double-entry began from the commencement
of the present century to be adopted by several governments
in the management of the public accounts, among others by
those of Austria, France and Holland, with highly beneficial
effects. Some attempts have been more recently made in this
country to introduce it into the government offices, and from
the great success which has attended them, this system will
probably soon be generally used.]</p>

<h2 id="odometer">ODOMETER.</h2>

<p>An Odometer, Pedometer, Perambulator, or Way-measurer,
is an instrument or machine by which the steps of a person
who walks, or the revolutions made by the wheel of a carriage,
can be counted, and by which the distance that one has
travelled can be ascertained. Vitruvius, in his tenth <span class="locked">book<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></span>,
describes a machine of this kind for a carriage, and which, in
his opinion, would answer for a ship. We are told by Capitolinus,
in the life of the emperor Pertinax, that among the
effects of the emperor Commodus exposed to sale, there were
carriages of various kinds, some of which “measured the road,
and pointed out the hours;” but whether by these words we
are to understand an odometer, cannot with certainty be determined.</p>

<p>That this instrument was known even in the fifteenth century,
can be proved from the carving on the ducal palace at Urbino&mdash;an
edifice erected in an uncommon style of magnificence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
by duke Frederic, who died in 1482. The ornaments here
employed form, almost, a complete representation of all the
warlike apparatus used at that period, both by sea and land;
and among these is the figure of a ship, which seems to be
furnished with an odometer; but whether the wheels and
springs, carved out apart, be intended to show the construction
of it, I will not venture to <span class="locked">decide<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></span>.</p>

<p>The celebrated John Fernel, physician to Catherine of Medici,
queen of France, measured with an instrument of this
kind, in 1550, a degree of the meridian between Paris and
Amiens, and found it to be 68,096 geometrical paces, or about
56,747 toises (364,960 English feet); that is, 303 toises less
than Picard found it to be; or about 300 toises less than later
measurements have made it. Picard himself, in his mathematical
measurement, assisted by the newest improvements, erred
123 toises. It is therefore very surprising that Fernel should
approach so near the truth with such an instrument. The
manner of constructing it however, as far as I know, appears
to be <span class="locked">lost<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></span>.</p>

<p>Levin Hulsius, in his Treatise of mechanical instruments,
published at Frankfort in 1604, describes an odometer, but
without naming the inventor. It appears, however, that it
was the production of Paul Pfinzing, born at Nuremberg in
<span class="locked">1554<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></span>; and who, besides other works, published, in 1598,
Methodus Geometrica, or a Treatise on measuring land, and
how to use proper instruments for that purpose, on foot, on
horseback, or in a carriage. This treatise, which was never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
sold, but given away by the author, contains a description of
the same instrument described by Hulsius, and which, as Nicolai
says, is still preserved in the collection of curiosities at
Dresden.</p>

<p>In the same collection is an odometer which Augustus, elector
of Saxony, who reigned between the years 1553 and 1586,
employed in measuring his territories. This instrument is
mentioned by <span class="locked">Beutel<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></span>, without naming the inventor; but I
think it very probable that it was made by Martin Feyhel, who
was born at Naumburg, and resided at Augsburg; as Von
<span class="locked">Stetten<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></span> relates, in his History of the Arts at Augsburg, that
Feyhel made a way-measurer (probably odometer) for the elector
of Saxony, and that he himself called it a new instrument
never before heard of. This artist was an intimate friend of
the celebrated Christopher Schissler, also of Augsburg, who in
1579 constructed a quadrant, still to be found at Oxford; and
in 1606 an armillary sphere, still preserved at Augsburg.</p>

<p>The emperor Rudolphus II., who reigned from 1576 to 1612,
and who was fond of, and acquainted with, the mechanical
arts, possessed two very curious odometers, which not only
pointed out distances, but also marked them down on paper
by the way. The description and use of one of these is given
by De <span class="locked">Boot<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></span>, who was that prince’s librarian; and what he
says has been copied by <span class="locked">Kircher<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></span>, and illustrated with a coarse
figure. It is not improbable that the before-mentioned Schissler
was the maker of this instrument, as we are informed by
Stetten that he constructed a great many machines and automata
for the emperor Rudolphus II. The other odometer,
which was much more curious, appears to have been constructed
by that emperor <span class="locked">himself<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></span>.</p>

<p>About the end of the 17th century, an artist in England,
named Butterfield, invented an odometer which met with
great approbation. In the first volume of the Philosophical
Transactions there are two papers written by this ingenious
man; but of his odometer I have not yet been able to find a
description.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the last century, Adam Frederick Zurner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
to whom we are indebted for good maps of the electorate
of Saxony, invented also an odometer, or geometrical carriage,
a description and figure of which, taken from Schramm’s
Saxonia Monumentis Viarum illustrata, is given by Nicolai.
This instrument is not now to be found in the Dresden collection.</p>

<p>In Bion’s Treatise on the construction of mathematical instruments,
improved by Doppelmayer, there is a description of
a pedometer, and the author praises a new invention by one
Sauveur.</p>

<p>In the year 1724 Meynier laid before the Royal Academy
of Sciences at Paris an odometer, a short account of which,
without a figure, is given in the history of the Academy for
that year. This machine was afterwards improved by Outhier;
and a description of the improvements, but without any figure,
is to be found in the history of the Academy for 1742. A full
description, together with a figure, may however be seen in a
work, entitled Machines et Inventions approuvées par l’Académie,
t. vii.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most perfect machine of this kind was that
made at Berlin by an artist named Hohlfeld, a short account
of which may be found in the ninth volume of the Hamburg
Magazine. A complete description I have not seen; but
I learn from Professor Bernoulli’s Tour through Brandenburg,
Pomerania, &amp;c., that a model of it is preserved in the excellent
collection of Count de Podewils at <span class="locked">Gusow<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></span>. The
inventor of it was a man of such rare talents, and rendered
such benefit to the public, that the following anecdotes of his
life may prove not unacceptable to many readers. It was
written by Professor Muller at Berlin, and transmitted to me
by Dr. Bloch.</p>

<p>Hohlfeld was born of poor parents at Hennerndorf in the
mountains of Saxony, in 1711. He learned the trade of lace-making
at Dresden, and early discovered a turn for mechanics
by constructing various kinds of clocks. From Dresden he
removed to Berlin to follow his occupation. As he was an
excellent workman, and invented several machines for shortening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
his labour, he found sufficient time to indulge his inclination
for mechanics; and he made there, at the same time that
he pursued his usual business, air-guns and clocks.</p>

<p>In the year 1748 he became acquainted with the celebrated
Sulzer, at whose desire he undertook the construction of a
machine for noting down any piece of music when played on
a harpsichord. A machine of this kind had been before invented
by Von Unger; but Hohlfeld, from a very imperfect
description, completed one without any other assistance than
that of his own genius. Of this machine, now in the possession
of the Academy of Sciences at Berlin, Sulzer gave a figure,
from which it was afterwards constructed in England. This
ingenious piece of mechanism was universally approved, though
several things may be wanting to render it complete; but no
one was so generous as to indemnify the artist for his expenses,
or to reward him for his labour.</p>

<p>About the year 1756, the Prussian minister, Count de Podewils,
took him into his service, chiefly for the purpose of constructing
water-works in his magnificent gardens at Gusow.
There he invented his well-known thrashing machine, and
another for chopping straw more expeditiously. He also displayed
his talent for invention by constructing an apparatus,
which, being fastened to a carriage, indicates the revolutions
made by the wheels. Such machines had been made before,
but his far exceeded every thing of the kind. Having lost
this machine by a fire, he invented another still simpler, which
was so contrived as to be buckled between the spokes of the
wheel. This piece of mechanism was in the possession of
Sulzer, who used it on his tour, and found that it answered
the intended purpose.</p>

<p>In the year 1765, when the duke of Courland, then hereditary
prince, resided at Berlin, he paid a visit to Hohlfeld,
and endeavoured to prevail on him to go to Courland, by
offering him a pension of 800 rix-dollars; but this ingenious
man was so contented with his condition, and so attached to
his friends, that he would not, merely for self-interest, quit
Berlin. His refusal, however, obtained for him a pension of
150 dollars from the king.</p>

<p>Besides the before-mentioned machines, he constructed,
occasionally, several useful models. Among these were a
loom for weaving figured stuffs, so contrived that the weaver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
had no need of anything to shoot through the <span class="locked">woof<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></span>; a pedometer
for putting in the pocket; a convenient and simple bed
for a sick person, which was of such a nature, that the patient,
with the least effort, could at any time raise or lower the
breast, and when necessary convert the bed into a stool; and
a carriage so formed, that if the horses took fright or ran
away, the person in it could, by a single push, loosen the pole
and set them at liberty. The two last models have been lost.</p>

<p>Every machine that this singular man saw, he altered and
improved in the simplest manner. All his own instruments
he made himself, and repaired them when damaged. But as
he was fonder of inventing than of following the plans of
others, he made them in such a manner that no one except
himself could use them. Several of his improvements were,
however, imitated by common workmen, though in a very
clumsy manner. It is worthy of remark, that he never bestowed
study upon anything; but when he had once conceived
an idea, he immediately executed it. He comprehended in a
moment whatever was proposed, and at the same time saw
how it was to be accomplished. He could therefore tell in an
instant whether a thing was practicable; if he thought it was
not, no persuasion or offer of money could induce him to attempt
it. He never pursued chimæras like those mechanics
who have not had the benefit of education or instruction; and
though this may be ascribed to the intercourse he had with
great mathematicians and philosophers, there is every reason
to believe that he would have equally guarded against them,
even if he had not enjoyed that advantage. The same quickness
of apprehension which he manifested in mechanics he
showed also in other things. His observations on most subjects
were judicious, and peculiar to himself; so that it may
be said, without exaggeration, that he was born with a philosophical
mind.</p>

<p>A little before his death he had the pleasure of seeing a
curious harpsichord he had made, which was purchased by
his Prussian Majesty, and placed in an elegant apartment in
the new palace at Potsdam. As he had for some time neglected
this instrument, the too great attention which he bestowed
on putting it in order contributed not a little to bring
on that disease which at last proved fatal to him. His clock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
having become deranged during his illness, he could not be
prevented, notwithstanding the admonition of his friend and
physician Dr. Stahls, from repairing it. Close application
occasioned some obstructions which were not observed till
too late; and an inflammation taking place, he died in 1771,
at the house of Count de Podewils, in the 60th year of his
age.</p>

<p>[The instrument now generally used in this country for
measuring the distance gone over, is that invented by Mr.
Payne, watchmaker, of Bond-street. In this ingenious contrivance
motion is communicated from the traveller to the
machinery of the pedometer, by means of a horizontal lever,
which is furnished with a weight at one end and a pivot or
axis at the other; under the lever is a spring, which keeps
the lever when at rest close up to a regulating screw; the
spring is so arranged as to be only just sufficiently strong to
overcome the weight of the lever and to prevent its falling
downwards.</p>

<p>When the body of the traveller is raised in progression, the
lever is impelled downwards by the jerk, and immediately returned
to its place by the spring, and so long as the motion is
continued the lever is constantly in a state of vibration. A
small ratchet-wheel is fixed to the axis of the lever, and beneath
it is another and larger ratchet-wheel which fits on the
same axis, but is not attached to it. These two wheels are
connected by a ratchet or pale in such a manner, that when the
lever falls, both wheels are moved forward one or more teeth,
but when the lever rises again from the force of the spring,
the larger ratchet-wheel is held stationary by a ratchet. The
larger wheel is connected with a series of toothed wheels and
pinions, by means of a pinion fixed on its under-surface. The
centre wheel carries an index or hand, which points to figures
on the dial-plate. The whole apparatus packs into the case
of a <span class="locked">watch<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></span>.]</p>

<h2 id="machine">MACHINE FOR NOTING DOWN MUSIC.</h2>

<p>As I have occasionally mentioned in the <a href="#odometer">preceding article</a>, a
machine for noting down any piece of music played on a
harpsichord or other musical instrument, I shall here add a
short history of the invention of it, as far as I know; and
with the greater pleasure, as another nation has laid claim to
it, though it belongs to my countrymen.</p>

<p>It appears incontestable, that a proposal for inventing such
a machine was first made known by an Englishman. In the
month of March 1747, John Freke transmitted to the Royal
Society a paper written by a clergyman of the name of Creed,
which was printed in the Philosophical Transactions under
the following title:&mdash;A Demonstration of the possibility of
making a machine that shall write extempore voluntaries, or
other pieces of music, as fast as any master shall be able to
play them upon an organ, harpsichord, &amp;c.; and that in a character
more natural and more intelligible, and more expressive
of all the varieties those instruments are capable of exhibiting,
than the character now in <span class="locked">use<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></span>. The author of this
paper however points out the possibility only of making such
a machine, without giving directions how to construct it.</p>

<p>In the year 1745, John Frederic Unger, then land-bailiff
and burgomaster of Einbec, and who is known by several
learned works, fell upon the same invention without the smallest
knowledge of the idea published in England. This invention
however, owing to the variety of his occupations, he
did not make known till the year 1752, when he transmitted
a short account of it, accompanied with figures, to the Academy
of Sciences at Berlin. The Academy highly approved
of it, and it was soon celebrated in several gazettes, but a description
of it was never printed.</p>

<p>A few days after Euler had read this paper of Unger’s before
the Academy, M. Sulzer informed Hohlfeld of the invention,
and advised him to exert his ingenuity in constructing
such a machine. In two weeks this untaught mechanic, without
having read Unger’s paper, and even without inspecting
the figures, completed the machine, which Unger himself had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
not been able to execute through want of an artist capable of
following his ideas.</p>

<p>Unger’s own description of his invention was printed, with
copper-plates, at Brunswick, in the year 1774, together with
the correspondence between him and Euler, and other documents.
A description of Hohlfeld’s machine, illustrated with
figures, was published after his death by Sulzer, in the new
memoirs of the Academy of Berlin, 1771, under the title of
‘Description of a machine for noting down pieces of music as
fast as they are played upon the harpsichord.’ Sulzer there
remarks, that Hohlfeld had not followed the plan sketched out
by Unger, and that the two machines differed in this&mdash;that
Unger’s formed one piece with the harpsichord, while that of
Hohlfeld could be applied to any harpsichord whatever.</p>

<p>When Dr. Burney visited Berlin, he was made acquainted
with Hohlfeld’s machine by M. Marpurg; and has been so
ungenerous, or rather unjust, as to say in his Musical Travels,
that it is an English invention, and that it had been before
fully described in the Philosophical Transactions. This
falsehood M. Unger has sufficiently refuted. Without repeating
his proofs, I shall here content myself with quoting
his own words, in the following passage:&mdash;“How can Burney
wish to deprive our ingenious Hohlfeld of the honour of
being the sole author of that invention, and to make an Englishman
share it with him, because our German happened to
execute successfully what his countryman Creed only suggested?
Such an attempt is as unjust in its consequences as
it is dishonourable to the English nation and the English
artists. When we reflect on the high estimation in which
music is held in England, the liberality of the English nobility,
and their readiness to spare no expenses in bringing forward
any useful invention, a property peculiar to the English, it
affords just matter of surprise that the English artists should
have suffered themselves to be anticipated by a German journeyman
lace-maker. To our Hohlfeld, therefore, will incontestably
remain the lasting honour of having executed a German
invention; and the Germans may contentedly wait to see
whether Burney will find an English mechanic capable of constructing
this machine, from the information given by his
countryman Creed.”</p>

<h2 id="refining">REFINING GOLD AND SILVER ORE BY QUICKSILVER.<br />

<span class="subhead">AMALGAMATION.</span></h2>

<p>It is well known that quicksilver unites very readily with
almost all metals, and when added in a considerable quantity
forms with them a paste which can be kneaded, and which is
called amalgam. On the other hand, as it does not unite with
the earths, being a metallic substance, it furnishes an excellent
medium for separating gold and silver from the substances
with which they are found. The amalgam is squeezed
through a piece of leather, in which these precious metals remain
with a certain portion of the quicksilver; and the former
are freed from the latter by means of fire, which volatilizes
the mercury. This amalgam made with gold serves also for
gilding metals (water-gilding)<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a>, if it be rubbed over them,
and afterwards heated till the quicksilver be driven off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
The first use of quicksilver is commonly reckoned a Spanish
invention, discovered about the middle of the sixteenth century;
but it appears from Pliny, that the ancients were acquainted
with amalgam and its use, not only for separating
gold and silver from earthy particles, but also for <span class="locked">gilding<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></span>.
Vitruvius describes the manner of recovering gold from cloth
in which it has been interwoven. The cloth, he says, is to be
put into an earthen vessel, and placed over the fire, in order
that it may be burnt. The ashes are to be thrown into water,
and quicksilver added to them. The latter attracts the particles
of the gold, and unites with them. The water is then to
be poured off, and the residue put into a piece of cloth;
which being squeezed with the hands, the quicksilver, on account
of its fluidity, oozes through the pores, and the gold is
left pure in a compressed <span class="locked">mass<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></span>. Isidore of Seville says also,
that quicksilver is best preserved in vessels of glass, as it penetrates
all other substances; and that without it neither silver
nor brass can be <span class="locked">gilded<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></span>. Modern mineralogists however
have this advantage over the ancient, that they know how to
separate the quicksilver from gold and silver without losing
it. Instead of exposing the amalgam to an open fire, as formerly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
and driving off the volatile metal, it is now put into a
retort, and the quicksilver is collected in a receiver for further
use.</p>

<p>Those also who wash gold from the sand found near rivers,
use quicksilver before their work is completed; and I am
strongly inclined to believe that this method prevailed in Germany
long before the discovery of the mines in America. In
the year 1582, John Michael Heberer described the washing
of gold as he saw it practised at Selz, not far from Strasburg;
and at that time quicksilver had been long employed for that
purpose. In Treitlinger’s Dissertation, also, concerning the
collecting of gold, and particularly in the Rhine, there is a
description of the manner in which gold sand is washed by
means of quicksilver, but no date is <span class="locked">mentioned<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></span>.</p>

<p>The history of employing mercury in procuring the American
silver is, as far as I know, most fully given by the Jesuit
<span class="locked">Acosta<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></span>, whose relation of the Indies abounds with curious
and useful information. The quicksilver mines of Peru are
situated in an extensive ridge of mountains near Guamanga,
on the south side of Lima, and at no great distance from it.
They are called Guancabelica, or Guancavilia. The mines
were discovered about the year 1566 or 1567, when Castro
was viceroy of Peru, by Henry Garces, or Graces, as he is
called by the Portuguese. This man was a native of Porto,
went to Peru in the Spanish service, and after the death of
his wife became canon of the cathedral of Mexico. He
translated the Lusiad of Camoens from the Portuguese into
Spanish, and this has procured him a place in Professor Dieze’s
translation of Velasquez’s History of Spanish Poetry. He
caused a law to be enacted that no silver bullion should be
suffered to circulate in Peru; but his greatest service was the
discovery of the quicksilver mines. As he was one day examining
the red earth, which the Indians use for paint, and
call <i>limpi</i>, he observed that it was native cinnabar; and as he
knew that quicksilver was extracted from it in Europe, he
went to the place where it was dug up, made some experiments,
and thus laid a foundation for the most important
works. No one however thought of employing this metal in
the silver mines till the year 1571, when Francis de Toledo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
being viceroy, one Pero Fernandes de Velasco came to Peru,
and offered to refine the silver by mercury, as he had learnt
at the smelting-houses in Mexico. His proposal being accepted,
and his attempts proving successful, the old methods
were abandoned, and that of amalgamation was adopted in its
<span class="locked">stead<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></span>. From this account it appears that Garces was not the
inventor of amalgamation, that it was introduced into Peru in
the year 1571, and that it had been long before practised in
Mexico; but at what period it was first used there I have not
been able to learn. The abbé Raynal says, that quicksilver
was a free article of trade till the year 1571, when it was declared
to belong exclusively to the crown; and this regulation
was made in consequence of its being employed in refining.
Robertson, in his History of America, tells us that the mines
of Guanacabelica were discovered in 1563, and that amalgamation
was introduced in 1574.</p>

<p>Anderson says, in his History of <span class="locked">Commerce<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></span>, that in the
second volume of Hakluyt there is a letter which shows the
use of quicksilver to have been a new invention in the year
1572. This letter I found, not in the second, but in the third
and last volume of the Voyages collected by <span class="locked">Hakluyt<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></span>. It
was written in the above year by a merchant named Henry
Hawks, and contains only the following information: “A
good owner of mines must have much quicksilver; and as for
this charge of quicksilver, it is a new invention, which they
find more profitable than to fine their ore with lead.”</p>

<p>Gobet, in a work entitled The Ancient Mineralogists of
France, accuses Alphonso Barba of asserting that he found
out amalgamation in the year 1609. To examine this charge,
it will be necessary to give some account of the metallurgic
works of that Spaniard, which, perhaps, may not prove unacceptable
to those who are fond of metallurgy and mineralogy.
Alvaro Alphonso Barba was born at Lepe, a small town in
Andalusia, and officiated many years as clergyman of the
church of St. Bernard, at Potosi. The first edition of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
work was printed in quarto, at Madrid, in 1640, in the Spanish
language, and illustrated with cuts. This book the Spaniards
for a long time concealed, because they considered it
as containing all their metallurgic secrets; though at that
time there were much better works of the kind in Germany,
and though amalgamation had been long known and practised.
Edward earl of Sandwich, being ambassador to Spain,
found however an opportunity of procuring a copy of it, as a
great rarity; and he began a translation of it into English, but
translated only the first two books. This translation was published
at London in octavo, in 1674, after the earl’s death,
and entitled The First Book of the Art of Metals, in which is
declared the manner of their generation, and the concomitants
of them. Written in Spanish by Albaro Alonso Barba,
translated by the earl of Sandwich. From this English edition
several German translations have been made, of which I
am acquainted with the following: two at Hamburg, one
printed in 1676, and the other in 1696; and two at Frankfort,
one in 1726, and another in 1739. In the year 1749 a
new edition appeared at Vienna. This edition, which is very
different from any of the former, was translated from the
French by one Godar, who was not a German, and who on
that account apologises in the preface for the badness of his
style. All these editions however are imperfect; for the original
contains five books, as we learn from Leibnitz, who
caused them to be transcribed. In the year 1751 a new translation
came out at Paris, entitled Metallurgy, or the art of
extracting and purifying metals, translated from the Spanish
of Alphonso Barba, by M. Gosfort, with the most curious dissertations
on mines and metallic operations; of this translation
the celebrated abbé Lenglet de Fresnoy is said to have
been the <span class="locked">editor<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></span>.</p>

<p>To judge by two of the German editions, Gobet has done
Barba an injustice. In that of 1676, I find Barba expressly
says he does not believe the ancients were acquainted with
the art of extracting silver from pounded ore by the means of
quicksilver. This certainly does not indicate that he laid
claim to the invention; besides, he everywhere speaks of
amalgamation as an art long used in America, but complains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
of the negligence with which it was practised. In a passage
however in the Vienna edition, and which has probably been
added by Gobet, we are told that in the year 1609, Barba
attempted to fix quicksilver, and with that view bethought
himself of mixing it with finely pounded silver ore; that he
at first imagined, with surprise, that he had obtained a mass
of silver, but that he soon perceived that the mercury was not
changed into silver, but had only attracted the particles of
that metal. “I was,” adds Barba, “highly pleased with my
new discovery of managing ore, of extracting its contents,
and of refining it; and this method I continued to practise.”
I imagine that Barba was still in Europe in 1609, and made
that experiment before he was acquainted with the smelting-works
in America. I am however of opinion, that one will
see by the original that Barba did not wish to claim the invention
of amalgamation as practised in the mines of America.</p>

<p class="fn2"><a name="Footnote_28" id="Footnote_28" href="#FNanchor_28" class="fnanchor">28</a>  [Among the improvements of recent date there are perhaps none of
greater importance than those of electro-gilding and gilding by immersion,
which have almost entirely superseded the process of gilding by an
amalgam of mercury and gold, so fatal to the workmen exposed to the
deleterious effects of the mercurial vapours. It is not our intention to
enter at present into a history of the invention of these processes; they
will more properly be reserved for a future volume, in which the discoveries
of the present century will be treated of. The following short outline
may however not prove uninteresting to the reader:&mdash;It had long been
known to experimentalists on the chemical action of voltaic electricity,
that solutions of several metallic salts were decomposed by its agency, and
the metal produced in its free state. The precipitation of copper by the
voltaic current was noticed by Mr. <span class="locked">Nicholson<a name="FNanchor_A" id="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">a</a></span> in a paper entitled ‘Account
of the new Electrical Apparatus of Sig. Alex. Volta, and experiments
performed with the same;’ but the earliest recorded process in electro-gilding
is probably that contained in a letter from Brugnatelli to Van
<span class="locked">Mons<a name="FNanchor_B" id="FNanchor_B" href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor">b</a></span>, in which he states that he had deposited a film of gold on ten silver
medals by bringing them into communication by means of a steel wire
with the negative pole of a voltaic pile, and keeping them one after the
other immersed in ammoniuret of gold newly made and well-saturated.
This announcement of a process identical with those now extensively used,
attracted no attention at the time it was made, and no further experiments
on the application of electricity to the deposition of metals for the purposes
of the arts were published until the year 1830, when Mr. E. Davy read a
paper before the Royal Society, in which he distinctly states that he had
gilded, silvered, coppered and tinned various metals by the voltaic <span class="locked">battery<a name="FNanchor_C" id="FNanchor_C" href="#Footnote_C" class="fnanchor">c</a></span>.
The experiments of Brugnatelli and Davy were however completely
lost sight of, and the art may be said to date its origin from the period
when the late Professor Daniell described his constant battery. Since
that time the art has continued to advance most rapidly, either in the perfecting
of the apparatus or in the pointing out of more suitable salts of
gold and silver, from which the metals might be precipitated. Among
those who have contributed to its advancement we may particularly instance
the names of our countrymen, Woolrich, Spencer, Jordan, Mason,
Murray, Smee, Elkington, Fox Talbot, and Tuck. Nearly all the gilt
articles manufactured at Birmingham are now gilded by the process patented
by Mr. Elkington, in which, after the articles have been cleansed by a
weak acid, they are placed in a hot solution of nitro-muriate of gold, to
which a considerable excess of bicarbonate of potash has been added; in
the course of a few seconds they thus receive a beautiful and permanent
coating of gold.]</p></div>

<h2 id="cold">COLD OR DRY GILDING.</h2>

<p>Dry gilding, as it is called by some workmen, is a light method
of gilding, by steeping linen rags in a solution of gold,
then burning them; and with a piece of cloth dipped in salt
water, rubbing the ashes over silver intended to be gilt. This
method requires neither much labour nor much gold, and
may be employed with advantage for carved work and ornaments.
It is however not durable.</p>

<p>I am of opinion that this manner of gilding is a German
invention, and that foreigners, at least the English, were first
made acquainted with it about the end of the last century;
for Robert Southwell describes it in the Philosophical Transactions
for the year 1698, and says that it was known to very
few goldsmiths in Germany.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="gold">GOLD VARNISH.</h2>

<p>As mankind could not have everything that they wished for
of gold, they were contented with incrusting many articles
with this precious metal. For that purpose the gold was beat
into plates, with which the walls of apartments, dishes, and
other vessels were covered. In early ages these plates were
thick, so that gilding in this manner was very <span class="locked">expensive<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></span>;
but in process of time the expense was much lessened, because
the art was discovered of making these gold plates
thinner, and of laying them on with a size. Articles however
ornamented in this manner were still costly, and the valuable
metal was always lost. Yellow golden colours of all kinds
were then tried; but these did not fully produce the required
effect, as they wanted that splendour peculiar to metals, and
appeared always languid and dull. It was not till modern
times that artists conceived the idea of overlaying with silver,
or some cheaper white metal, such things as they wished to
have the appearance of gold, and then daubing them over
with a yellow transparent varnish, in order to give to the
white metal the colour of gold, and to the colour the splendour
of metal. “When we cover our houses with gold,”
says Seneca, “do we not show that we delight in deception?
for we know that coarse wood is concealed under that <span class="locked">gold<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></span>.”</p>

<p>This ingenious process, which at present is employed all
over Europe in gilding wooden frames, coaches, and various
articles, and which was formerly used in the preparation of the
now old-fashioned leather tapestry, was invented towards the
end of the 17th century. Anderson, in his Historical and
chronological deduction of the Origin of Commerce, says that
it was introduced into England by one Evelyn in the year
1633; and quotes, in support of this assertion, The Present
State of England, printed in 1683.</p>

<p>This invention, however, does not belong to the English,
but to the Italians, and properly to the Sicilians. Antonino<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
Cento, an artist of Palermo, found out the gold varnish, and in
the year 1680 published there an account of the method of
preparing it. That work I have never seen; but I found this
information in a book printed at Palermo in 1704, and entitled
The Inventions of the <span class="locked">Sicilians<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></span>. Among the few important
things contained in this book, the greater part of which is
compiled from old Latin writers, there is, in the additions, a
receipt how to prepare the gold varnish (<i>vernice d’oro</i>). The
whole account I shall transcribe, as the authors of the French
Journal of Agriculture, Commerce, and the Arts, thought it
worth their trouble to make it known in that work in 1778.</p>

<p>“Take shell-lac, and having freed it from the filth and bits
of wood with which it is mixed, put it into a small linen bag,
and wash it in pure water, till the water no longer becomes
red; then take it from the bag and suffer it to dry. When it
is perfectly dry, pound it very fine; because the finer it is
pounded the more readily will it dissolve. Then take four
parts of spirit of wine, and one of the lac, reduced, as before
directed, to an impalpable powder, so that for every four
pounds of spirit you may have one of lac: mix these together,
and, having put them into an alembic, graduate the fire
so that the lac may dissolve in the spirit. When dissolved,
strain the whole through a strong piece of linen cloth; throw
away what remains in the cloth, as of no use, and preserve
the liquor in a glass bottle closely corked. This is the gold
varnish which may be employed for gilding any kind of wood.</p>

<p>“When you wish to use it, you must, in order that the work
may be done with more smoothness, employ a brush made of
the tail of a certain quadruped called the vari, well-known to
those who sell colours for painting; and with this instrument
dipped in the liquor wash gently over, three times, the wood
which has been silvered. You must, however, remember every
time you pass the brush over the wood to let it dry; and thus
your work will be extremely beautiful, and have a resemblance
to the finest gold.”</p>

<p>After this invention was made known, it was not difficult to
vary, by several methods, the manner of preparing it. Different
receipts, therefore, have for that purpose been given in a
number of books, such as Croker’s Painter, and others: and,
on this account, young artists are frequently at a loss which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
to choose; and when a receipt is found better than another,
experienced artists keep it always secret.</p>

<p>With the preparation of that varnish used for gilding leather
tapestry Reaumur was acquainted, and from his papers it was
made known by Fougeroux de Bondaroy. The method of
making the English varnish was communicated by Scarlet to
Hellot, in the year 1720; and by Graham to Du Fay, in 1738.
In the year 1761, Hellot gave the receipt to the Academy of
Sciences at Paris, who published it in their memoirs for that
year.</p>

<p>If it be true, as Fougeroux says, that gilded tapestry was

<h2 id="tulips">TULIPS.</h2>

<p>The greater part of the flowers which adorn our gardens have
been brought to us from the Levant. A few have been procured
from other parts of the world; and some of our own indigenous
plants, that grow wild, have, by care and cultivation, been
so much improved as to merit a place in our parterres. Our
ancestors, perhaps, some centuries ago paid attention to flowers;
but it appears that the Orientals, and particularly the Turks,
who in other respects are not very susceptible of the inanimate
beauties of nature, were the first people who cultivated a variety
of them in their gardens for ornament and pleasure. From
their gardens, therefore, have been procured the most of those
which decorate ours; and amongst these is the tulip.</p>

<p>Few plants acquire through accident, weakness, or disease,
so many tints, variegations, and figures, as the tulip. When
uncultivated, and in its natural state, it is almost of one colour,
has large leaves, and an extraordinary long stem. When it
has been weakened by culture, it becomes more agreeable in
the eyes of the florist. The petals are then paler, more variegated,
and smaller; the leaves assume a fainter or softer green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
colour: and this masterpiece of culture, the more beautiful it
turns, grows so much the weaker; so that, with the most
careful skill and attention, it can with difficulty be transplanted,
and even scarcely kept alive.</p>

<p>That the tulip grows wild in the Levant, and was thence
brought to us, may be proved by the testimony of many writers.
Busbequius found it on the road between Adrianople and
<span class="locked">Constantinople<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></span>; Shaw found it in Syria, in the plains between
Jaffa and Rama; and Chardin on the northern confines of
Arabia. The early-blowing kinds, it appears, were brought
to Constantinople from Cavala, and the late-blowing from
Caffa; and on this account the former are called by the Turks
<i>Cavalá lalé</i>, and the latter <i>Café lalé</i>. Caval is a town on the
eastern coast of Macedonia, of which Paul Lucas gives some
account; and Caffa is a town in the Crimea, or peninsula of
Gazaria, as it was called, in the middle ages, from the Gazares,
a people very little <span class="locked">known<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></span>.</p>

<p>Though florists have published numerous catalogues of the
species of the tulip, botanists are acquainted only with two, or
at most three, of which scarcely one is indigenous in <span class="locked">Europe<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></span>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
All those found in our gardens have been propagated from
the species named after that learned man, to whom natural
history is so much indebted, the Linnæus of the sixteenth century,
Conrad Gesner, who first made the tulip known by a botanical
description and a figure. In his additions to the works
of Valerius Cordus, he tells us that he saw the first in the
beginning of April 1559, at Augsburg, in the garden of the
learned and ingenious counsellor John Henry Herwart. The
seeds had been brought from Constantinople, or, according to others,
from Cappadocia. This flower was then known in Italy
under the name of tulipa, or tulip, which is said to be of Turkish
extraction, and given to it on account of its resembling a
<span class="locked">turban<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></span>.</p>

<p>Balbinus asserts that Busbequius brought the first tulip-roots
to Prague, from which they were afterwards spread all
over <span class="locked">Germany<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></span>. This is not improbable; for Busbequius
says, in a letter written in 1554, that this flower was then new
to him; and it is known that besides coins and manuscripts he
collected also natural curiosities, and brought them with him
from the Levant. Nay, he tells us that he paid very dear to
the Turks for these tulips; but I do not find he anywhere says
that he was the first who brought them from the East.</p>

<p>In the year 1565 there were tulips in the garden of M. Fugger,
from whom Gesner wished to procure <span class="locked">some<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></span>. They first
appeared in Provence, in France, in the garden of the celebrated
Peyresc, in the year <span class="locked">1611<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></span>.</p>

<p>After the tulip was known, Dutch merchants, and rich
people at Vienna, who were fond of flowers, sent at different
times to Constantinople for various kinds. The first roots
planted in England were sent thither from Vienna, about the
end of the sixteenth century, according to <span class="locked">Hakluyt<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></span>; who is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
however, wrong in ascribing to Clusius the honour of having
first introduced them into Europe; for that naturalist only collected
and described all the then known species.</p>

<p>These flowers, which are of no further use than to ornament
gardens, which are exceeded in beauty by many other
plants, and whose duration is short and very precarious, became,
in the middle of the 17th century, the object of a trade
such as is not to be met with in the history of commerce, and
by which their price rose above that of the most precious
metals. An account of this trade has been given by many
authors; but by all late ones it has been misrepresented.
People laugh at the <span class="locked">Tulipomania<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></span>, because they believe that
the beauty and rarity of the flowers induced florists to give
such extravagant prices: they imagine that the tulips were
purchased so excessively dear in order to ornament gardens;
but this supposition is false, as I shall show hereafter.</p>

<p>This trade was not carried on throughout all Europe, but
in some cities of the Netherlands, particularly Amsterdam,
Haarlem, Utrecht, Alkmaar, Leyden, Rotterdam, Hoorn, Enkhuysen,
and Meedenblick; and rose to the greatest height in
the years 1634&ndash;37<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a>. Munting has given, from some of the
books kept during that trade, a few of the prices then paid, of
which I shall present the reader with the following. For a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
root of that species called the Viceroy the after-mentioned
articles, valued as below expressed, were agreed to be <span class="locked">delivered:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="in0">These tulips afterwards were sold according to the weight of
the roots. Four hundred <span class="locked">perits<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></span> of Admiral Leifken cost
4400 florins; 446 ditto of Admiral Von der Eyk, 1620 florins;
106 perits Schilder cost 1615 florins; 200 ditto Semper Augustus,
5500 florins; 410 ditto Viceroy, 3000 florins, &amp;c. The
species Semper Augustus has been often sold for 2000 florins;
and it once happened that there were only two roots of it to
be had, the one at Amsterdam and the other at Haarlem. For
a root of this species, one agreed to give 4600 florins, together
with a new carriage, two gray horses, and a complete harness.
Another agreed to give for a root twelve acres of land; for
those who had not ready money, promised their moveable and
immoveable goods, houses and lands, cattle and clothes. A
man whose name Munting once knew, but could not recollect,
won by this trade more than 60,000 florins in the course of
four months. It was followed not only by mercantile people,
but also by the first noblemen, citizens of every description,
mechanics, seamen, farmers, turf-diggers, chimney-sweeps,
footmen, maid-servants and old clothes-women, &amp;c. At first,
every one won and no one lost. Some of the poorest people
gained in a few months houses, coaches and horses, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
figured away like the first characters in the land. In every
town some tavern was selected which served as a ’Change,
where high and low traded in flowers, and confirmed their
bargains with the most sumptuous entertainments. They
formed laws for themselves, and had their notaries and clerks.</p>

<p>When the nature of this trade is considered, it will readily
be perceived, that to get possession of these flowers was not
the real object of it, though many have represented it in
that light. The price of tulips rose always higher from the
year 1634 to the year 1637; but had the object of the purchaser
been to get possession of the flowers, the price in such
a length of time must have fallen instead of risen. “Raise
the prices of the productions of agriculture, when you wish
to reduce them,” says Young; and in this he is undoubtedly
right, for a great consumption causes a greater reproduction.
This has been sufficiently proved by the price of asparagus at
Göttingen. As it was much sought after, and large prices
paid for it, more of it was planted, and the price has fallen.
In like manner plantations of tulips would have in a short
time been formed in Holland, and florists would have been
able to purchase flowers at a much lower price. But this
was not done; and the chimney-sweeper, who threw aside his
besom, did not become a gardener, though he was a dealer in
flowers. Roots would have been imported from distant countries,
as asparagus was from Hanover and Brunswick to Göttingen;
the high price would have induced people to go to
Constantinople to purchase roots, as the Europeans travel to
Golconda and Visapour to procure precious stones; but the
dealers in tulips confined themselves to their own country,
without thinking of long journeys. I will allow that a flower
might have become scarce, and consequently dearer; but it
would have been impossible for the price to rise to a great
height, and continue so for a year. How ridiculous would it
have been to purchase useless roots with their weight of gold,
if the possession of the flower had been the only object!
Great is the folly of mankind; but they are not fools without
a cause, as they would have been under such circumstances.</p>

<p>During the time of the Tulipomania, a speculator often
offered and paid large sums for a root which he never received,
and never wished to receive. Another sold roots
which he never possessed or delivered. Oft did a nobleman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
purchase of a chimney-sweep tulips to the amount of 2000
florins, and sell them at the same time to a farmer; and neither
the nobleman, chimney-sweep or farmer had roots in
their possession, or wished to possess them. Before the tulip
season was over, more roots were sold and purchased, bespoke
and promised to be delivered, than in all probability
were to be found in the gardens of Holland; and when Semper
Augustus was not to be had, which happened twice, no
species perhaps was oftener purchased and sold. In the space
of three years, as Munting tells us, more than ten millions
were expended in this trade in only one town of Holland.</p>

<p>To understand this gambling traffic, it may be necessary
to make the following supposition. A nobleman bespoke of
a merchant a tulip-root, to be delivered in six months, at the
price of 1000 florins. During these six months the price of
that species of tulip must have risen or fallen, or remained as
it was. We shall suppose that at the expiration of that time
the price was 1500 florins; in that case the nobleman did not
wish to have the tulip, and the merchant paid him 500 florins,
which the latter lost and the former won. If the price was
fallen when the six months were expired, so that a root could
be purchased for 800 florins, the nobleman then paid to the
merchant 200 florins, which he received as so much gain;
but if the price continued the same, that is 1000 florins, neither
party gained or lost. In all these circumstances, however,
no one ever thought of delivering the roots or of receiving
them. Henry Munting, in 1636, sold to a merchant
at Alkmaar, a tulip-root for 7000 florins, to be delivered in six
months; but as the price during that time had fallen, the
merchant paid, according to agreement, only ten per cent.
“So that my father,” says the son, “received 700 florins for
nothing; but he would much rather have delivered the root
itself for 7000.” The term of these contracts was often much
shorter, and on that account the trade became brisker. In
proportion as more gained by this traffic, more engaged in it;
and those who had money to pay to one, had soon money to
receive of another; as at faro, one loses upon one card, and
at the same time wins on another. The tulip-dealers often
discounted sums also, and transferred their debts to one another;
so that large sums were paid without cash, without
bills, and without goods, as by the <i>Virements</i> at Lyons. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
whole of this trade was a game at hazard, as the Mississippi
trade was afterwards, and as stock-jobbing is at present. The
only difference between the tulip-trade and stock-jobbing is,
that at the end of the contract the price in the latter is determined
by the Stock-exchange; whereas in the former it
was determined by that at which most bargains were made.
High- and low-priced kinds of tulips were procured, in order
that both the rich and the poor might gamble with them;
and the roots were weighed by perits, that an imagined whole
might be divided, and that people might not only have whole,
but half and quarter lots. Whoever is surprised that such a
traffic should become general, needs only to reflect upon
what is done where lotteries are established, by which trades
are often neglected, and even abandoned, because a speedier
mode of getting fortunes is pointed out to the lower classes.
In short, the tulip-trade may very well serve to explain stock-jobbing,
of which so much is written in gazettes, and of which
so many talk in company without understanding it; and I
hope, on that account, I shall be forgiven for employing so
much time in illustrating what I should otherwise have considered
as below my <span class="locked">notice<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></span>.</p>

<p>At length, however, this trade fell all of a sudden. Among
such a number of contracts many were broken; many had
engaged to pay more than they were able; the whole stock
of the adventurers was consumed by the extravagance of the
winners; new adventurers no more engaged in it; and many,
becoming sensible of the odious traffic in which they had been
concerned, returned to their former occupations. By these
means, as the value of tulips still fell, and never rose, the
sellers wished to deliver the roots <i>in natura</i> to the purchasers
at the prices agreed on; but as the latter had no desire for
tulips at even such a low rate, they refused to take them or
to pay for them. To end this dispute, the tulip-dealers of
Alkmaar sent in the year 1637 deputies to Amsterdam; and
a resolution was passed on the 24th of February, that all contracts
made prior to the last of November 1636 should be
null and void; and that, in those made after that date, purchasers
should be free on paying ten per cent. to the vender.</p>

<p>The more people became disgusted with this trade, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
more did complaints increase to the magistrates of the different
towns; but as the courts there would take no cognizance
of it, the complainants applied to the states of Holland and
West Friesland. These referred the business to the determination
of the provincial council at the Hague, which on
the 27th of April 1637 declared that it would not deliver its
opinion on this traffic until it had received more information
on the subject; that in the mean time every vender should
offer his tulips to the purchaser; and, in case he refused to
receive them, the vender should either keep them, or sell
them to another, and have recourse on the purchaser for any
loss he might sustain. It was ordered also, that all contracts
should remain in force till further inquiry was made. But as
no one could foresee what judgement would be given respecting
the validity of each contract, the buyers were more obstinate
in refusing payment than before; and venders, thinking
it much safer to accommodate matters amicably, were at
length satisfied with a small profit instead of exorbitant gain;
and thus ended this extraordinary traffic, or rather gambling.</p>

<p>It is however certain, that persons fond of flowers, particularly
in Holland, have paid, and still pay, very high prices for
tulips, as the catalogues of florists <span class="locked">show<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></span>. This may be called
the lesser Tulipomania, which has given occasion to many
laughable circumstances. When John Balthasar Schuppe
was in Holland, a merchant gave a herring to a sailor who
had brought him some goods. The sailor, seeing some valuable
tulip-roots lying about, which he considered as of little
consequence, thinking them to be onions, took some of them
unperceived, and ate them with his herring. Through this
mistake the sailor’s breakfast cost the merchant a much greater
sum than if he had treated the prince of Orange. No less
laughable is the anecdote of an Englishman who travelled
with Matthews. Being in a Dutchman’s garden, he pulled a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
couple of tulips, on which he wished to make some botanical
observations, and put them in his pocket; but he was apprehended
as a thief, and obliged to pay a considerable sum before
he could obtain his <span class="locked">liberty<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></span>.</p>

<p>Reimman and others accuse Just. Lipsius of the <span class="locked">Tulipomania<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></span>;
but if by this word we understand that gambling
traffic which I have described, the accusation is unfounded.
Lipsius was fond of scarce and beautiful flowers, which he
endeavoured to procure by the assistance of his friends, and
which he cultivated himself with great care in his garden;
but this taste can by no means be called a <span class="locked">mania<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></span>. Other
learned men of the same age were fond of flowers, such as
John <span class="locked">Barclay<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></span>, Pompeius de Angelis, and others, who would
probably have been so, even though the cultivation of flowers
had not been the prevailing taste. It however cannot be denied,
that learned men may be infected with epidemical follies.
In the present age, many have become physiognomists because
physiognomy is in fashion; and even animal magnetism has
met with partisans to support it.</p>

<h2 id="canary">CANARY BIRD.</h2>

<p>This little bird, highly esteemed for its song, which is reared
with so much care, particularly by the fair sex, and which
affords an innocent amusement to those who are fond of the
wild notes of nature, is a native of those islands from which
it takes its name. As it was not known in Europe till the
fifteenth century, no account of it is to be met with in any of
the works of the old ornithologists. Bellon, who about the
year 1555 described all the birds then known, does not so
much as mention it. At that period it was brought from the
Canary Islands. It was therefore so dear that it could be
procured only by people of fortune, and those who purchased
were even often imposed <span class="locked">on<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></span>. It was called the sugar-bird,
because it was said to be fond of the sugar-cane, and that it
could eat sugar in great abundance. This circumstance seems
to be very singular; for that substance is to many birds a
poison. Experiments have shown, that a pigeon to which
four drachms of sugar were given died in four hours, and that
a duck which had swallowed five drachms did not live seven
hours after. It is certain, therefore, that the power of poison
is relative.</p>

<p>The first figure of this bird is given by Aldrovandus, but it
is small and inaccurate. That naturalist reckons the Canary
bird among the number of those which were scarce and expensive,
as it was brought from a distant country with great
care and attention. The first good figure of it is to be found
in <span class="locked">Olina<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></span>: it has been copied by both Johnston and Willughby.</p>

<p>In the middle of the seventeenth century these birds began
to be bred in Europe, and to this the following circumstance,
related by Olina, seems to have given occasion. A vessel,
which, among other commodities, was carrying a number of
Canary birds to Leghorn, was wrecked on the coast of Italy;
and these birds, being thus set at liberty, flew to the nearest
land, which was the Island of Elba, where they found the
climate so favourable, that they multiplied, and perhaps would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
have become domesticated, had they not been caught in snares;
for it appears that the breed of them there has been long since
destroyed. Olina says that the breed soon degenerated; but
it is probable that these Canary birds, which were perhaps all
males, did at the Island of Elba what the European sailors do
in India. By coupling with the birds of the island, they may
have produced mules. Such hybrids are described by Gesner
and other <span class="locked">naturalists<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></span>.</p>

<p>The breeding of these birds was at first attended with great
difficulty; partly because the treatment and attention they required
were not known, and partly because males chiefly, and
few females, were brought to Europe. We are told that the
Spaniards once forbade the exportation of males, that they
might secure to themselves the trade carried on in these birds,
and that they ordered the bird-catchers either to strangle the
females or to set them at <span class="locked">liberty<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a></span>. But this order seems to
have been unnecessary; for, as the females commonly do not
sing, or are much inferior in the strength of their notes to the
males, the latter only were sought after as objects of trade.
In the like manner, as the male parrots are much superior in
colour to the females, the males are more esteemed, and more
of them are brought to Europe than of the females. It is
probable, therefore, that in our system of ornithology, many
female parrots belonging to species already well-known are
considered as distinct species. It was at first believed that
those Canary birds bred in the Canary Islands were much
better singers than those reared in Europe; but this at present
is <span class="locked">doubted<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></span>. In latter times various treatises have been published
in different languages, on the manner of breeding these
birds, and many people have made it a trade, by which they
have acquired considerable gain. It does no discredit to the
industry of the Tyrolese that they have carried it to the greatest
extent. At Ymst there is a company who, after the breeding
season is over, send out persons to different parts of Germany
and Switzerland to purchase birds from those who breed them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
Each person brings with him commonly from three to four hundred,
which are afterwards carried for sale, not only through
every part of Germany, but also to England, Russia, and even
Constantinople. About sixteen hundred are brought every
year to England; where the dealers in them, notwithstanding
the considerable expense they are at, and after carrying them
about on their backs, perhaps a hundred miles, sell them for
five shillings apiece. This trade, hitherto neglected, is now
carried on in Schwarzwalde; and at present there is a citizen
here at Göttingen, who takes with him every year to England
several Canary birds and bullfinches (<i>Loxia pyrrhula</i>), with
the produce of which he purchases such small wares as he has
occasion for.</p>

<p>The principal food of these birds is the Canary seed, which,
as is commonly affirmed, and not improbably, was first brought,
for this purpose, from the Canary Islands to Spain, and thence
dispersed all over Europe. Most of the old botanists, however,
are of opinion that the plant which produces it is the
same as that called <i>Phalaris</i> by <span class="locked">Dioscorides<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a></span>. Should this be
true, it will follow that this kind of grass must have grown
wild in other places besides the island it takes its name from;
which is not improbable. But those who read the different
descriptions which the ancients have given of <i>Phalaris</i>, will,
in my opinion, observe that they may be equally applied to
more plants; and Pliny seems to have used this name for more
than one species of <span class="locked">grass<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a></span>.</p>

<p>However this may be, it is certain that this seed, when it
was used as food for these birds, began to be cultivated first
in Spain, and afterwards in the southern parts of France. At present
it is cultivated in various parts, and forms no inconsiderable
branch of trade, particularly in the island of Sicily,
where the plant is called <i>Scagliuola</i>, or <i>Scaghiola</i>. The seed
is sold principally to the French and the Genoese. In England,
the industrious inhabitants of the Isle of Thanet, particularly
those around Margate and Sandwich, gain considerably
by this article, as they can easily transport it to London
by water.</p>

<p>That this plant might be cultivated with little trouble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
in Germany, is shown by the yearly experience of those who
raise it in their gardens, and by its having become so naturalized
in some parts of Hesse, that it propagates by seed of
itself in the fields. The use of the seed might also be extended,
for it yields a good meal; but the grains are not easily
freed from the husks.</p>

<p>I shall here take occasion to remark, that <span class="locked">Savary<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a></span> has been
guilty of an error, when he says that archil is cultivated in
the Canary Islands in order to be sold as food for Canary
birds. One may easily perceive that this mistake has arisen
from his confounding that lichen used for dyeing with this
kind of grass; and I should not have considered it worth notice,
had it not been copied into Ludovici’s Dictionary of
Trade, from which, perhaps, it may be copied into the works
of others.</p>

<h2 id="archil">ARCHIL.</h2>

<p>Under the names Orseille, Orceille, Orsolle, Ursolle, Orcheil,
Orchel, in Italian <span class="locked">Oricello<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></span>, Orcella, Roccella, in Dutch Orchillie,
and in English Archil, Canary weed or Orchilla weed,
is understood a lichen used for dyeing, and from which a kind
of paint is also prepared. This species of lichen, of which the
best figure and a full description may be seen in <span class="locked">Dillenius<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a></span>,
is by Linnæus called <i>Lichen roccella</i>. It is found in abundance
in some of the islands near the African coast, particularly
in the Canaries, and in several of the islands in the Archipelago.
It grows upright, partly in single partly in double
stems, which are about two inches in height. When it is old
these stems are crowned with a button, sometimes round and
sometimes of a flat form, which Tournefort very properly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
compares to the excrescences on the arms of the Sepia. Its
colour is sometimes a light, and sometimes a dark gray. Of
this lichen with lime, urine, ammoniacal salts, or a solution of
ammonia prepared by distillation, is formed a dark red paste,
which in commerce has the same name, and which is much
used in dyeing. That well-known substance called litmus is
also made of it.</p>

<p>Theophrastus<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a>, <span class="locked">Dioscorides<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a></span>, and their transcriber <span class="locked">Pliny<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></span>,
give the name of <i>Phycos thalassion</i> or <i>pontion</i> to a plant
which, notwithstanding its name, is not a sea-weed but a lichen,
as it grew on the rocks of different islands, and particularly
on those of Crete or Candia. It had in their time been
long used for dyeing wool, and the colour it gave when fresh
was so beautiful, that it excelled the ancient purple, which
was not red, as many suppose, but violet. Pliny tells us, that
with this lichen dyers gave the ground or first tint to those
cloths which they intended to dye with the costly purple. At
least I so understand, with Hardouin and others, the words
<i>conchyliis substernitur</i>, which the French dyers express by the
phrase <i>donner le pied</i>.</p>

<p>Though several kinds of lichen produce a similar red dye,
I agree in opinion with Dillenius, that <i>Phycos thalassion</i> is our
archil; for at present no species is known which communicates
so excellent a colour, and which corresponds so nearly
with the description of Theophrastus. Besides, it is still collected
in the Grecian islands, and it appears that it has been
used there since the earliest <span class="locked">ages<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></span>.</p>

<p>Tournefort<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> found this lichen in the island Amorgos, which
lies on the eastern side of Naxos, and which at present is
called Morgo. In his time it was sent to England and Alexandria,
at the rate of ten rix-dollars per hundred weight; and
he says expressly that it was common in the other islands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
He shows from Suidas, Julius <span class="locked">Pollux<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></span>, and other ancient
writers, that this island was once celebrated for a kind of red
linen cloth, which in commerce had the name of the island;
and he conjectures, not without probability, that it might have
been dyed with this lichen.</p>

<p>Imperati<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> says, that the <i>roccella</i>, of which he gives a figure,
was procured from the Levant. This naturalist gives the figure
also of a lichen from Candia, used for dyeing, which was then
called <i>rubicula</i>, and which, as may be seen in <span class="locked">Bauhinus<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a></span>, is
comprehended under the name of Roccella. Dillenius and
Linnæus, however, make it a distinct species; and the latter
names it <i>Lichen fuciformis</i>. This distinction is, perhaps, not
improper: for the <i>rubicula</i> does not grow like a shrub or bush,
as the <i>roccella</i>, but belongs rather to the foliaceous lichens. Be
this as it may, it is certain, as Dillenius has remarked, and as
I know from my own observation, that <i>L. fuciformis</i> is often
mixed with the real roccella, and particularly with that brought
from the Canary Islands; but whether it be equally good,
experience has not yet taught us.</p>

<p>From what has been said, I think I may venture to conclude
that our archil was not unknown to the ancient Grecians.
But when was it first employed as a dye by the moderns, and
introduced into our commerce? Some writers are of opinion
that this drug was first found in the Canary Islands, and afterwards
in the Levant. The use of it, therefore, is not older
than the last discovery of that island. That this opinion is
false, will appear from what follows.</p>

<p>Among the oldest and principal Florentine families is that
known under the name of the Oricellarii or Rucellarii, Ruscellai
or Rucellai, several of whom have distinguished themselves
as statesmen and men of letters. This family are descended
from a German nobleman named Ferro or Frederigo,
who lived in the beginning of the twelfth <span class="locked">century<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></span>. One of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
his descendants in the year 1300 carried on a great trade in
the Levant, by which he acquired considerable riches, and
returning at length to Florence with his fortune, first made
known in Europe the art of dyeing with archil. It is said
that a little before his return from the Levant, happening to
make water on a rock covered with this lichen, he observed
that the plant, which was there called <i>respio</i> or <i>respo</i>, and in
Spain <i>orciglia</i>, acquired by the urine a purple, or, as others
say, a red colour. He therefore tried several experiments;
and when he had brought to perfection the art of dyeing wool
with this plant, he made it known at Florence, where he alone
practised it for a considerable time, to the great benefit of
the state. From this useful invention the family received
the name of Oricellarii, from which at last was formed <span class="locked">Rucellai<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a></span>.</p>

<p>As several documents, still preserved among the Florentine
archives, confirm the above account of the origin of this family
name, from the discovery of dyeing with <span class="locked">oricello<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a></span>, we may,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
in my opinion, consider it as certain that the Europeans, and
first the Florentines, were made acquainted with this dye-stuff
and its use in the beginning of the fourteenth century. At
that time the Italians brought from the East the seeds of many
arts and sciences, which, afterwards sown and nurtured in
Europe, produced the richest harvests; and nothing is more
certain than that the art of dyeing was brought to us from the
East by the Italians. I do not believe that the merit of having
discovered this dye by the above-mentioned accident is due to
that Florentine; but I am of opinion that he learnt the art in
the Levant, and on his return taught it to his countrymen,
which was doing them no small <span class="locked">service<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></span>. After that period
the Italians long procured archil from the Levant for themselves,
and afterwards for all Europe. I say for a long time,
because since the discovery of the Canary Islands the greater
part of that substance has been procured from them.</p>

<p>These islands, after being a considerable time lost and forgotten,
were again discovered about the end of the fourteenth
or the beginning of the fifteenth century, and since that time
they have been much frequented by the Europeans. One of
the first who endeavoured to obtain an establishment there,
was John de Betancourt, a gentleman of Normandy, who in
1400, or, as others say, in 1417, landed on Lancerotta.
Amongst the principal commodities which this gentleman and
other Europeans brought back with them was archil, which was
found there more beautiful and in greater abundance than anywhere
else; and Betancourt enjoyed in idea the great profit
which he hoped to derive from this article in commerce. Glass is
surprised that the Europeans, immediately upon their arrival,
sought after this lichen with as much eagerness and skill as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
they did after gold in America, though they were not so well
acquainted with the former as the latter before the discovery
of these new <span class="locked">lands<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a></span>. But as this is not true, the wonder will
cease.</p>

<p>According to information procured in the year 1731, the
island of Teneriffe produced annually five hundred quintals of
this moss; Canary, four hundred; Forteventura, Lancerotta,
and Gomera, three hundred each; and Fero, eight hundred;
making in all two thousand six hundred quintals. In the islands
of Canary, Teneriffe and Palma, the moss belongs to the crown;
and in the year 1730 it was let by the king of Spain for one
thousand five hundred piastres. The farmers paid then for
collecting it from fifteen to twenty rials per hundred <span class="locked">weight<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></span>.
In the rest of the islands it belongs to private proprietors, who
cause it to be collected on their own account. In the beginning
of the last century a hundred weight, delivered on board
at Santa Cruz, the capital of Teneriffe, was worth from only
three to four piastres; but since 1725 it has cost labour amounting
to ten piastres, because it has been in great request at
London, Amsterdam, Marseilles, and throughout all <span class="locked">Italy<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></span>.
In the year 1726 this lichen cost at London eighty pounds
sterling per ton, as we are told by Dillenius, and in 1730 it
bore the same price.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the year 1730, the captain of an English
vessel, which came from the Cape de Verde islands, brought
a bag of archil to Santa Cruz by way of trial. He discovered
his secret to some Spanish and Genoese merchants, who, in
the month of July 1731, resolved to send a ship to these
islands. They landed on that of St. Anthony and St. Vincent,
where in a few days they obtained five hundred quintals of
this lichen, which they found in such abundance, that it cost
them nothing more than a piastre per cent. by way of present
to the governor. The archil of the Cape de Verde islands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
appears larger, richer, and longer than that of the Canaries,
and this, perhaps, is owing to its not being collected every
<span class="locked">year<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a></span>. Adanson, in 1749, found also the greater part of the
rocks in Magdalen island, near Senegal, covered with this lichen.
Though the greater part of our archil is at present
procured from the Canary and Cape de Verde islands, a considerable
quantity is procured also from the Levant, from Sicily,
as Glass says, and from the coast of Barbary; and some years
ago the English merchants at Leghorn caused this lichen to
be collected in the island of Elba, and paid a high price for
<span class="locked">it<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a></span>.</p>

<p>Our dyers do not purchase raw archil, but a paste made of
it, which the French call <i>orseille en pâte</i>. The preparation of
it was for a long time kept a secret by the Florentines. The
person who, as far as I know, made it first known was Rosetti;
who, as he himself tells us, carried on the trade of a dyer at
Florence. Some information was afterwards published concerning
it by <span class="locked">Imperati<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></span> and Micheli the <span class="locked">botanist<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></span>. In later
times this art has been much practised in France, England,
and Holland. Many druggists, instead of keeping this paste
in a moist state with urine, as they ought, suffer it to dry, in
order to save a little dirty work. It then has the appearance
of a dark violet-coloured earth, with here and there some white
spots in it.</p>

<p>The Dutch, who have found out better methods than other
nations of manufacturing many commodities, so as to render
them cheaper, and thereby to hurt the trade of their neighbours,
are the inventors also of <span class="locked">lacmus<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></span>, a preparation of archil
called <i>orseille en pierre</i>, which has greatly lessened the use
of that <i>en pâte</i>, as it is more easily transported and preserved,
and fitter for use; and as it is besides, if not cheaper, at least
not dearer. This art consists, undoubtedly, in mixing with
that commodity some less valuable substance, which either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
improves or does not much impair its quality, and which at
the same time increases its <span class="locked">weight<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a></span>. Thus they pound cinnabar
and smalt finer than other nations, and yet sell both these
articles cheaper. In like manner they sift cochineal, and sell
it at a less price than what is unsifted.</p>

<p>It was for a long time believed that the Dutch prepared
their lacmus from those linen rags which in the south of France
are dipped in the juice of the <i>Croton tinctorium</i><a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a>; and this
idea appeared the more probable, as most of this <i>tournesol
en drapeaux</i> was bought up by the Hollanders: but, as they
are the greatest adulterators of wine in Europe, they may perhaps
have used these rags to colour Pontack and other wines.
It is however not improbable that they at first made lacmus of
them, as their dye approaches very near to that of archil. At
present it is almost certainly known that <i>orseille en pâte</i> is the
principal ingredient in <i>orseille en pierre</i>, that is in <span class="locked">lacmus<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a></span>:
and for this curious information we are indebted to <span class="locked">Ferber<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a></span>.
But whence arises the smell of the lacmus, which appears to
me like that of the Florentine iris? Some of the latter may,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
perhaps, be mixed with it; for I think I have observed in it
small insoluble particles, which may have been pieces of the
roots. The addition of this substance can be of no use to improve
the dye; but it may increase the weight, and give the
lac more body; and perhaps it may be employed to render imperceptible
some unpleasant smell, for which purpose the roots
of that plant are used on many other occasions.</p>

<p>Another kind of lichen, different from the roccella, which
in commerce is known by the names <i>orseille de terre</i>, <i>orseille
d’Auvergne</i>, is used also for the like purpose; but it contains
fewer and weaker colouring particles. This species, in botany,
is called <i>Lichen Parellus</i> (<i>Lecanora Parella</i>), and is distinguished
from the roccella by its figure, as it grows only in
a thin rind on the rocks. It is collected in Auvergne, on rocks
of granite and volcanic productions, and in some parts of Languedoc;
the greater part of it is brought from St. Flour. Its
name, <i>perelle</i>, comes from an old Languedocian word <i>pére</i>
(<i>pierre</i>, a rock); as <i>roccella</i>, afterwards transformed into <i>orseille</i>,
is derived from <i>rocca</i>. The use of <i>perelle</i> is very trifling:
the Dutch purchase it to make lacmus, perhaps on account of
its low price. This lichen has been found also in <span class="locked">Northumberland<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a></span>
and other mountainous districts of Great Britain, but it
is not collected there for any purpose.</p>

Mariæ Manni de Florentinis Inventis Commentarium. Ferrariæ, 1731,
p. 37, from which I have extracted the following:&mdash;“One of this family
resided formerly a long time in the Levant, where he carried on trade,
according to the custom of the Florentine nation. Being one day in the
fields, and happening to make water on a plant, of which there was great
abundance, he observed that it immediately became extraordinarily red.
Like a prudent man, therefore, he resolved to make use of this secret of
nature, which till that time had lain hid; and having made several experiments
on that herb, and finding it proper to dye cloth, he sent some of
it to Florence, where, being mixed with human urine and other things, it
has always been employed to dye cloth purple. This plant, which is called
<i>respo</i>, is in Spain named <i>orciglia</i>, and by botanists commonly <i>corallina</i>.
The mixture made with it is called <i>oricello</i>, and has been of great utility
and advantage to the woollen manufacture, which is carried on to greater
extent in Florence than in any other city. From this circumstance the individuals
of that family, by being the inventors of oricello, have been called
Oricellai, and have been beloved by the people for having procured to
them this particular benefit. Thus has written John di Paolo Rucellai
(<i>Manni says that this learned and opulent man wrote in the year 1451</i>);
and the same account is still given by dyers in our city, who relate and
affirm that their ancestors have for a century exercised the art of dyeing,
and that they know the above from tradition.”
</p>
<p>
This is confirmed by another passage:&mdash;“One of this family, on account
of the trade carried on faithfully and honestly by the Florentines, travelled
to the Levant, and brought thence to Florence the art, or rather secret, of
dyeing in oricello.”</p></div>

of this family:&mdash;“This family acquired their name from a secret brought by
one of them from the Levant, which was that of dyeing in oricello, never
before used in this country. On that account they were afterwards called
Oricellari, as appears from several records among the archives of Florence,
and then by corruption Rucellari and Rucellai. Of their origin many
speak, and all agree that they came into Tuscany from Britain.”</p></div>

<h2 id="magnetic">MAGNETIC CURES.</h2>

<p>The external use of the magnet, to cure the tooth-ache and
other disorders, is a remedy brought into fashion in modern
times, but not a new discovery, as supposed by Lessing, who
ascribes it to <span class="locked">Paracelsus<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></span>. It was known to Aëtius, who lived
so early as the year 500. That author says, “We are assured
that those who are troubled with the gout in their hands or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
their feet, or with convulsions, find relief when they hold a
magnet in their <span class="locked">hand<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a></span>.” He does not however give any proof
of this from his own experience: and perhaps he doubted the
truth of it. The above passage contains the oldest account
known at present respecting this virtue; for the more ancient
writers speak only of the internal use of the magnet.</p>

<p>It is evident therefore that this cure has not been discovered
in later times, but that it has been preserved by the old physicians
copying it from each other into their works. In like
manner, many things are mentioned in the Materia Medica
which were used or proposed by the ancients, but into the properties
of which they never made sufficient inquiry.</p>

<p>Paracelsus recommended the magnet in a number of diseases,
as fluxes, hæmorrhages, &amp;c. Marcellus, who lived in the fifteenth
century, assures us that it cures the <span class="locked">tooth-ache<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a></span>. The
same virtue is ascribed to it by Leonard <span class="locked">Camillus<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a></span>, who lived
in the sixteenth century: and <span class="locked">Wecker<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a></span>, who was nearly co-temporary,
says that the magnet when applied to the head,
cures the head-ache; and adds that Holler had taken this cure
from the works of the <span class="locked">ancients<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a></span>. We read also in <span class="locked">Porta<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></span>,
that it was recommended for the head-ache; and in <span class="locked">Kircher<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a></span>,
that it was worn about the neck as a preventive against convulsions,
and affections of the nerves. About the end of the
17th century magnetic tooth-picks and ear-pickers were made,
and extolled as a secret preventive against pains in the teeth,
eyes and <span class="locked">ears<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a></span>.</p>

<p>[In addition to these external uses of the magnet, in which
it was supposed to act by a peculiar power over the nervous
system, it has been employed on account of its true magnetic
properties. Thus Kirkringius, Fabricius Hildanus, and subsequently
Morgagni, have used it to remove particles of iron
which had accidentally fallen into the eyes. Kircher employed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
it also to cure hernia. The patient took iron-filings internally;
and the loadstone in the state of powder mixed with some
vegetable substance, thus forming a magnetic plaster, was applied
to the hernia. Even Ambrose Paré states on the authority
of a surgeon, that several patients had been thus cured.</p>

<p>About the 16th and early in the 17th century, two cases
occurred, one near Prague in Bohemia, the other in Prussia,
in which a knife was swallowed, but it unfortunately got too
far and passed into the stomach. By the application of these
magnetic plasters, the point became attracted towards the surface,
so that it could be removed by <span class="locked">incision<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a></span>.</p>

<p>In the 18th century, after the properties of magnets had
begun to be scientifically investigated, they were made of
various forms and their effects studied in numerous parts of
Europe, and many treatises were published on their supposed
properties. Perhaps the most important and best authenticated,
are those of MM. Audry and Thouret. These experimenters
believed that they were effective agents.</p>

<p>Since that time, the use of magnets as remedial agents has
been almost entirely laid aside and forgotten, it having been
found that no constancy was exhibited in the results of their
application, and that their occasional supposed efficacy depended
upon other circumstances, which were overlooked from
the sufferers’ attention being engrossed by the magnet. The
application of the magnet to remove small particles of iron or
steel which have accidentally fallen into the eyes, has been
lately revived. In some manufactories, where these minute
particles are constantly thrown off in the grinding of hardware
and driven into the eyes, large magnets are kept fixed
at a proper height, so that the workmen can resort to them
immediately. Such is the case for instance at Fairbairne in
Belgium, and we believe the same has been adopted in some
of our own manufactories to catch the floating particles, and
thus to prevent their being drawn into the lungs during respiration.
The reader may form some idea of the effective manner
in which magnets can be applied, from the following incident
which occurred to Prof. Faraday, whilst experimenting
with a powerful (electro-) magnet; an iron candlestick which
happened to be standing near its poles on the table at which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
he was at work flew to them, attracted with such violence as
to displace or break everything in its way.</p>

<p>In the 18th century, a new supposed magnetic power was
discovered, and with various success has continued to be applied
to the delusion of the public. About 1770, Father Hehl, a
jesuit, the Professor of Astronomy at Vienna, who had great
faith in the influence of the loadstone on human diseases, and
had invented steel plates of a peculiar form, which he impregnated
with magnetic virtues and applied to the cure of diseases,
communicated his discoveries to Anton Mesmer, who subsequently
invented animal magnetism or mesmerism. Mesmer
made use of his friend Hehl’s plates to employ the magnet according
to certain notions of his own. In his subsequent
experiments magnets were gradually dispensed with, and as
practised in modern times, they have been found unnecessary.
Hence mesmerism or animal magnetism has no relation to the
magnetism of the magnet, and may therefore form the subject
of a future article.</p>

<p>About the year 1798, a man named Perkins invented a
method of treating various diseases with metallic bars called
tractors; these were applied to and drawn over various parts
of the body, and were supposed to cure numerous maladies,
such as ulcers, head-aches, &amp;c. These instruments were patented.
A few years afterwards, Dr. Falconer had wooden tractors
made so exactly to resemble those of Perkins, that they could
not be distinguished by the eye; on employing these on a large
scale at the Bath hospital, he found that exactly the same effects
and cures were produced by one as the other. Since that
time these tractors have hardly been heard of, and are now
forgotten.</p>

<p>Quite recently, a new means has been contrived in England
for deluding the public, in the form of rings, which are to be
worn upon the fingers or toes, and are said to prevent the
occurrence of, and cure various diseases. They are called
galvanic rings. But this invention may be with propriety
classed with the real magnet, animal magnetism and tractation.</p>

<p>What has been stated relative to the metallic tractors,
equally applies to the magnetic rings; for although by the
contact of the two metals of which they are composed an infinitesimally
minute current of electricity, hence also of magnetism,
is generated, still from the absurd manner in which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
pieces of metal composing the ring are arranged, and which
displays the most profound ignorance of the laws of electricity
and magnetism, no trace of the minute current traverses
the finger or toe on which the ring is worn; so that a wooden,
any other ring, or none at all, would have exactly the same
effect, as regards the magnetism or galvanism.]</p>

<h2 id="secret">SECRET POISON.</h2>

<p>Under this name are generally understood all poisons which
can be administered imperceptibly, and which gradually shorten
the life of man, like a lingering disease. They were not first
discovered in the 17th century in France and Italy as
many believe, but were known to the ancient Greeks and
Romans, by whom they were used. I must however allow,
that they were never prepared with more art at any period,
or in any country, or employed oftener and with more success,
than they were in these countries, and at that time. If it be
true that they can be prepared in such a manner as to occasion
death at a certain period previously determined, or that
the person to whom they are given will die within a certain
time limited, it must be confessed that the ancient poisoners
have been far exceeded by the modern. But this advantage
will be considered as scarcely possible, when one reflects upon
the many variable circumstances which have an influence on
the operation of medicines and poisons; and it has often
happened that a company have swallowed the same poison, at
the same time, and in the same quantity, some of whom have
died sooner and some later, while some have survived. Thus
died Pope Alexander VI. in the year 1503, and Cæsar Borgia
recovered without any loss of health, though, by the bottles
being changed through mistake, he drank of the poison that
had been prepared for the other guests alone. At any rate, I
am of opinion that the celebrated Tophania, when she engaged
to free wives from disagreeable husbands within stated weeks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
and days, must have had certain and very accurate information
respecting their constitution and manner of living, or, as
the physicians say, their idiosyncrasy.</p>

<p>Some physicians have doubted respecting secret <span class="locked">poison<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a></span>;
and others have only denied that its effects can with certainty
be regulated to a fixed <span class="locked">time<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a></span>. I agree in opinion with the
latter; but the former can be confuted by many examples both
of ancient and modern times; for that the ancients were acquainted
with this kind of poison, can be proved by the testimony
of Plutarch, Quintilian, and other respectable authors.
We are told by Plutarch, that a slow poison, which occasioned
heat, a cough, spitting of blood, consumption, and a weakness
of intellect, was administered to Aratus of <span class="locked">Sicyon<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a></span>; and Quintilian
in his Declamations, speaks of this poison in such a
manner as proves that it must then have been well <span class="locked">known<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a></span>.
It cannot be said that such an invention was too great for that
period, or that it required more knowledge of chemistry than
any one possessed; for the Indians in America are acquainted
with a most perfect poison of this kind, and can employ it
with so much skill, that the person to whom it is given cannot
guard against the treachery, even with the utmost precaution,
but infallibly dies, though in a lingering manner, often after
the expiration of some <span class="locked">years<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
Theophrastus speaks of a poison which could be moderated
in such a manner as to have effect in two or three months, or
at the end of a year, or two years; and he remarks that the
death, the more lingering it was, became the more miserable.
This poison was prepared from aconitum, a plant which, on
that account, people were forbidden to have in their possession,
under pain of capital <span class="locked">punishment<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a></span>. He relates also, that
Thrasyas had discovered a method of preparing from other
plants a poison which, given in small doses of a drachm, occasioned
an easy but certain death, without any pain, and which
could be kept back for a long time without causing weakness
or corruption. This Thrasyas, whose scholar Alexias carried
the art still further, was a native of Mantinea, a city in Arcadia,
and is celebrated by Theophrastus on account of his abilities,
and particularly his knowledge of botany; but those are
mistaken who ascribe to him the discovery of secret poison.</p>

<p>This poison was much used at Rome about two hundred
years before the Christian æra. As several persons of distinction
died the same year at that period, and of the like distemper,
an inquiry being made into the cause, a maid-servant
gave evidence against some ladies of the first families, who,
she said, prepared and distributed poison; and above a hundred
and fifty of them were convicted and <span class="locked">punished<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a></span>. As so
many had learnt this destructive art, it could not be suppressed;
and we find sufficient proofs in the Roman history that it was
continually preserved. Sejanus caused such a secret poison
to be administered by an eunuch to Drusus, who gradually
declined afterwards, as by a consumptive disorder, and at
length <span class="locked">died<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a></span>. Agrippina, being desirous of getting rid of
Claudius, but not daring to despatch him suddenly, and yet
wishing not to leave him sufficient time to make new regulations
respecting the succession to the throne, made choice
of a poison which should deprive him of his reason, and gradually
consume him. This she caused to be prepared by an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
expert poisoner, named Locusta, who had been condemned to
death for her infamous actions, but saved that she might be
employed as a state engine. The poison was given to the
emperor in a dish of mushrooms; but as, on account of his
irregular manner of living, it did not produce the desired effect,
it was assisted by some of a stronger <span class="locked">nature<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a></span>. This Locusta
prepared also the poison with which Nero despatched Britannicus,
the son of Agrippina, whom his father Claudius wished to
succeed him on the throne. As this poison occasioned only a
dysentery, and was too slow in its operation, the emperor compelled
Locusta by blows, and by threatening her with death, to
prepare in his presence one more powerful. It was first tried
on a kid; but as the animal did not die till the end of five hours,
she boiled it a little longer, until it instantaneously killed a pig
to which it had been given, and this poison despatched Britannicus
as soon as he had tasted <span class="locked">it<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a></span>. For this service the emperor
pardoned Locusta, rewarded her liberally, and gave her pupils
whom she was to instruct in her art, in order that it might not
be lost.</p>

<p>The art of preparing this poison must have been well understood
also at Carthage. When M. Attilius Regulus, the
Roman general, who had been taken by the Carthaginians,
was sent to Rome to propose to the senate that the Carthaginian
prisoners might be restored in exchange for him, he prevented
this negotiation, because he knew that a poison had
been administered to him, by which the state would soon be
deprived of his services. He returned, therefore, to Carthage,
in compliance with the promise he had made to the enemy, who
put him to death with the most exquisite <span class="locked">torture<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a></span>.</p>

<p>All these poisons were prepared from plants, particularly
aconite, hemlock and poppy, or extracted from animal substances.
Among those made from the latter, none is more
remarkable than that supplied by the sea-hare, <i>lepus marinus</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
with which, as Philostratus <span class="locked">says<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a></span>, Titus was despatched by
Domitian. Without here attempting to define the substances
employed by the ancients to compose their poisons, I shall only
observe, that the <i>lepus marinus</i>, the terrible effects of which
are expressly mentioned by Dioscorides, Galen, Nicander,
Aëtius, Ælian<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a>, <span class="locked">Pliny<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a></span>, and others, is that animal called at
present in the Linnæan system <i>Aplysia depilans</i><a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a>, as Rondelet
conjectured, and has been since fully proved by <span class="locked">Bohadsch<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a></span>.
This animal poison however seems to have been seldom used,
as it easily betrays itself by some peculiar symptoms. It appears
that it was not known to Aristotle, at least he makes no
mention of <span class="locked">it<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a></span>. With the far stronger, and now common
mineral poisons the ancients were not acquainted; for their
arsenic was what we call orpiment, and not that pernicious
metallic oxide which formed the principal ingredient of those
secret poisons which in latter times were in France and Italy
brought to a diabolical <span class="locked">perfection<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a></span>.</p>

<p>No one was ever more infamous by this art than Tophania,
or Toffana, a woman who resided first at Palermo, and afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
at Naples. She sold those drops, which from her acquired
the name of <i>aqua Tophania</i>, <i>aqua della Toffana</i>, and
which were called also <i>acquetta di Napoli</i>, or only <i>acquetta</i>;
but she distributed her preparation by way of charity to such
wives as wished to have other husbands. From four to six
drops were sufficient to destroy a man; and it was asserted
that the dose could be so proportioned as to operate in a certain
time. As she was watched by the government, she fled to
an ecclesiastical asylum; and when Keysler was at Naples in
1730, she was then still living, because no one could, or was
willing to take away her life, while under that protection. At
that time she was visited by many strangers out of curiosity.</p>

<p>In Labat’s Travels through <span class="locked">Italy<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a></span> we also find some information
which may serve still further to illustrate the history of
Tophania. She distributed her poison in small glass phials,
with this inscription, <i>Manna of St. Nicholas of Bari</i>, and
ornamented with the image of the saint. A miraculous oil,
employed by folly in the cure of many diseases, drops from
the tomb of that saint which is shown at Bari in the kingdom
of Naples; and on this account it is dispersed in great abundance
under the like name. It was therefore the best appellation
which Tophania could give to her poison, because the
reputed sanctity of it prevented the custom-house officers from
examining it too closely. When the viceroy was informed of
this, which I think was in 1709, Tophania fled from one convent
to another, but was at length seized and thrown into
prison. The clergy raised a loud outcry on account of this
violation of ecclesiastical freedom, and endeavoured to excite
the people to insurrection. But they were soon appeased on
a report being spread that Tophania had confessed she had
poisoned all the springs in the city. Being put to the rack,
she acknowledged her wickedness, and confessed to having
caused the death of not less than 600 persons; named those
who had protected her, who were immediately dragged from
churches and monasteries; and declared that the day before
she had absconded, she had sent two boxes of her manna to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
Rome, where it was found in the custom-house, but she did
not accuse any one of having ordered it. She was afterwards
strangled, and to mitigate the archbishop, her body was thrown
at night into the area of the convent from which she had been
taken. Tophania however was not the only person at Naples
who understood the making of this poison; for Keysler says
that at the time he was there it was still secretly prepared and
much employed.</p>

<p>In the year 1659, under the government of Pope Alexander
VII., it was observed at Rome that many young married
women were left widows, and that many husbands died
when they became disagreeable to their wives. Several of
the clergy declared also, that for some time past various persons
had acknowledged at confession that they had been
guilty of poisoning. As the government employed the utmost
vigilance to discover these poisoners, suspicion fell upon a
society of young married women, whose president appeared to
be an old woman who pretended to foretell future events, and
who had often predicted very exactly many deaths to persons
who had cause to wish for them. To ascertain the truth, a
crafty female, given out to be a person of considerable distinction,
was sent to this old woman, pretending that she wished
to obtain her confidence, and to procure some of her drops
for a cruel and tyrannical husband. The whole society were
by this stratagem arrested; and all of them, except the fortune-teller,
whose name was Hieronyma Spara, confessed before
they were put to the torture.&mdash;“Where now,” cried she, “are
the Roman princes, knights and barons, who on so many occasions
promised me their protection! Where are the ladies
who assured me of their friendship! Where are my children
whom I have placed in so distinguished situations!” In order
to deter others from committing the like crime, one Gratiosa,
Spara’s assistant, three other women, and the obstinate Spara
herself, who still entertained hopes of assistance till the last
moment, were hanged in the presence of innumerable spectators.
Some months after, several more women were executed
in the same manner; some were whipt, and others were banished
from the country. Notwithstanding these punishments,
the effects of this inveterate wickedness have been from
time to time remarked. Le Bret, to whom we are indebted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
for the above account, <span class="locked">says<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a></span> that Spara was a Sicilian, and
acquired her knowledge from Tophania at Palermo. If that
be true, the latter must have been early initiated in villany,
and must have become when very young a teacher of her infamous
art. Keysler calls her a little old woman.</p>

<p>The art of poisoning never excited more attention than it
did in France about the year <span class="locked">1670<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a></span>. Mary Margaret d’Aubray,
daughter of the lieutenant-civil Dreux d’Aubray, was in
the year 1651 married to the Marquis de Brinvillier, son of
Gobelin president of the Chamber of Accounts, who had a
yearly income of thirty thousand livres, and to whom she
brought a portion of two hundred thousand. He was mestre-de-camp
of the regiment of Normandy, and during the course
of his campaigns became acquainted with one Godin de Sainte
Croix, a young man of a distinguished family, who served as
a captain of cavalry in the regiment of Trassy. This young
officer, who was then a needy adventurer, became a constant
visitor of the marquis, and in a short time paid his addresses
to the marchioness, who lost her husband after she had helped
to dissipate his large fortune, and was thus enabled to enjoy
her amours in greater freedom. Her indecent conduct, however,
gave so much uneasiness to her father, that he procured
a lettre de cachet, had Sainte Croix arrested while in a carriage
by her side, and thrown into the <span class="locked">Bastille<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a></span>. Sainte Croix
there got acquainted with an Italian named Exili, who understood
the art of preparing poison, and from whom he learnt
it. As they were both set at liberty after a year’s imprisonment,
Sainte Croix kept Exili with him until he became perfectly
master of the art, in which he afterwards instructed the
marchioness, in order that she might employ it in bettering
the circumstances of both. When she had acquired the principles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
of the art, she assumed the appearance of a nun, distributed
food to the poor, nursed the sick in the Hôtel-Dieu,
and gave them medicines, but only for the purpose of trying
the strength of her poison undetected on these helpless
<span class="locked">wretches<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a></span>. It was said in Paris, by way of satire, that no
young physician, in introducing himself to practice, had ever
so speedily filled a churchyard as Brinvillier. By the force
of money, she prevailed on Sainte Croix’s servant, called La
Chaussée, to administer poison to her father, into whose service
she got him introduced, and also to her brother, who was
a counsellor of the parliament, and resided at his father’s
house. To the former the poison was given ten times before
he died; the son died sooner; but the daughter, Mademoiselle
d’Aubray, the marchioness could not poison, because perhaps
she was too much on her guard; for a suspicion soon arose
that the father and son had been poisoned, and the bodies
were opened. She would however have escaped, had not
Providence brought to light the villany.</p>

<p>Sainte Croix, when preparing poison, was accustomed to
wear a glass mask; but as this once happened to drop off by
accident, he was suffocated, and found dead in his laboratory.
Government caused the effects of this man, who had no
family, to be examined, and a list of them to be made out.
On searching them, there was found a small box, to which
Sainte Croix had affixed a written request, that after his death
it might be delivered to the Marchioness de Brinvillier, or in
case she should not be living, that it might be <span class="locked">burnt<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a></span>. Nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
could be a greater inducement to have it opened than
this singular petition; and that being done, there was found
in it a great abundance of poisons of every kind, with labels
on which their effects, proved by experiments made on animals,
were marked. When the marchioness heard of the death
of her lover and instructor, she was desirous to have the
casket, and endeavoured to get possession of it, by bribing
the officers of justice; but as she failed in this, she quitted the
kingdom. La Chaussée, however, continued at Paris, laid
claim to the property of Sainte Croix, was seized and imprisoned,
confessed more acts of villany than were suspected,
and was in consequence broke alive on the wheel in 1673.</p>

<p>A very active officer of justice, named Desgrais, was despatched
in search of the Marchioness de Brinvillier, who was
found in a convent at Liège, to which she had fled from England.
To entice her from this privileged place, which folly
had consecrated for the protection of vice, Desgrais assumed
the dress of an abbé, found means to get acquainted with her,
acted the part of a lover, and, having engaged her to go out
on an excursion of pleasure, arrested her. Among her effects
at the convent, there was found a confession, written by her
own hand, which contained a complete catalogue of her
crimes. She there acknowledged that she had set fire to
houses, and that she had occasioned the death of more persons
than any one ever suspected. She remarked also, that
she had continued a virgin only till the seventh year of her
age. Notwithstanding all the craft which she employed to
escape, she was conveyed to Paris, where she at first denied
everything; and, when in prison, she played picquet to pass
away the time. She was however convicted, brought to a confession
of her enormities, became a convert, as her confessor
termed it, and went with much firmness to the place of execution,
on the 16th of July, 1676; where, when she beheld the
multitude of the spectators, she exclaimed in a contemptuous
manner, “You have come to see a fine spectacle!” She was
beheaded and afterwards burnt; a punishment too mild for
such an <span class="locked">offender<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a></span>. As she had been amused with some hopes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
of a pardon, on account of her relations, when she mounted
the scaffold, she cried out, “<i>C’est donc tout de bon!</i><a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a>”</p>

<p>Among a number of persons suspected of being concerned
in this affair, was a German apothecary, named Glaser, who
on account of his knowledge in chemistry, was intimate with
Exili and Sainte Croix. From him they had both procured
the materials which they used, and he was some years confined
in the Bastille; but the charge against him being more
minutely investigated, he was declared innocent, and set at
liberty. He was the author of a Treatise on Chemistry, printed
at Paris in 1667, and reprinted afterwards at Brussels in 1676,
and at Lyons in 1679.</p>

<p>By the execution of this French Medea, the practice of
poisoning was not suppressed; many persons died from time
to time under very suspicious circumstances; and the archbishop
was informed from different parishes that this crime
was still confessed, and that traces of it were remarked both
in high and in low families. For watching, searching after, and
punishing poisoners, a particular court, called the <i>Chambre de
Poison</i> or <i>Chambre ardente</i>, was at length established in 1679.
This court, besides other persons, detected two women named
La Vigoreux and La <span class="locked">Voisin<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a></span>, who carried on a great traffic
in poisons. The latter was a midwife. Both of them pretended
to foretell future events, to call up ghosts, and to teach
the art of finding hidden treasures, and of recovering lost or
stolen goods. They also distributed philtres, and sold secret
poison to such persons as they knew they could depend upon,
and who wished to employ them either to get rid of bad husbands,
or recover lost lovers. Female curiosity induced several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
ladies of the first rank, and even some belonging to the
court, to visit these women, particularly La Voisin; and who,
without thinking of poison, only wished to know how soon a
husband, a lover, the king or his mistress, would die. In the
possession of La Voisin was found a list of all those who had
become dupes to her imposture. They were arrested and
carried before the above-mentioned court, which, without
following the usual course of justice, detected secret crimes
by means of spies, instituted private trials, and began to imitate
the proceedings of the holy inquisition. In this list were
found the distinguished names of the Countess de Soissons,
her sister the Duchess de Bouillon, and Marshal de Luxembourg.
The first fled to Flanders to avoid the severity and
disgrace of imprisonment; the second saved herself by the
help of her friends; and the last, after he had been some
months in the Bastille, and had undergone a strict examination,
by which he almost lost his reputation, was set at liberty as
innocent. Thus did the cruel Louvois the war minister, and
the Marchioness de Montespan, ruin those who opposed their
measures. La Vigoreux and La Voisin were burnt alive on
the 22nd of February 1680, after their hands had been bored
through with a red-hot iron and cut off. Several persons of
ordinary rank were punished by the common hangman; those
of higher rank, after they had been declared by this tribunal
not guilty, were set at liberty; and in 1680 an end was put
to the <i>Chambre ardente</i>, which in reality was a political inquisition.</p>

<p>It is certain that notwithstanding such punishments, like
crimes have given occasion to unjust succession both in Italy
and in France, and that attempts have been made for the
same purpose even in the northern kingdoms. It is known
that in Denmark Count Corfitz de Ulfeld was guilty, though it
was not proved, of having intended to give the king a poison,
which should gradually destroy him like a <span class="locked">lethargy<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a></span>. Charles
XI. also, king of Sweden, died by the effects of such a poison.
Having ruined several noble families by seizing on their property,
and having after that made a journey to Torneo, he fell
into a consumptive disorder which no medicine could cure.
One day he asked his physician in a very earnest manner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
what was the cause of his illness? The physician replied,
“Your majesty has been loaded with too many maledictions.”
“Yes,” returned the king, “I wish to God that the reduction
of the nobility’s estates had not taken place, and that I had
never undertaken a journey to Torneo!” After his death his
intestines were found to be full of small <span class="locked">ulcers<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a></span>.</p>

<p>The oftener poisoning in this manner happens, the more it
is to be wished that preventives and antidotes were found out,
and that the symptoms were ascertained; but this is hardly
possible as long as it is not known of what the poison properly
consists. Governments, however, have wisely endeavoured to
conceal the recipes, by suppressing the criminal procedures.
Pope Alexander VII. caused them to be shut up in the castle
of St. Angelo; in France, it is said, they were burnt together
with the criminals; in Naples only the same precaution was
not taken. I do not know that observations on the bodies of
persons destroyed by slow poison have been ever published;
for what Pitaval says on that subject is not <span class="locked">sufficient<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a></span>. People
talk of powders and pills, but the greater part of this kind of
poison appears to be a clear insipid water, and that prepared
by Tophania never once betrayed itself by any particular effects
on the body. The sale of aqua-fortis was a long time forbidden
at Rome, because it was considered as the principal ingredient;
but this is very improbable. At Paris it was once
believed that succession powder consisted of diamond dust
pounded exceedingly fine. Without assenting to this idea,
one may contradict Voltaire, who conceives that diamond dust
is not more prejudicial than powder of coral. It may be rather
compared to that fine sand which is rubbed off from our mill-stones,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
and which we should consider and guard against as a
secret poison, were we not highly negligent and careless of our
health in the use of <span class="locked">food<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a></span>. In the casket of Sainte Croix were
found corrosive sublimate, opium, regulus of antimony, vitriol,
and a large quantity of poison ready prepared, the principal
ingredients of which the physicians were not able to distinguish.
Many have affirmed that sugar of lead was the chief
<span class="locked">ingredient<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a></span>; but the consequences of the poison did not seem
to indicate the use of that metal. For some years past a
harmless plant, which is only somewhat bitter and astringent,
the ivy-leaved Toadflax (<i>Linaria Cymbalaria</i>), that grows on
old walls, has been loaded with the opprobrium of producing
this slow poison, while at the same time it has been celebrated
by others on account of its medicinal properties; but it is
perhaps not powerful enough to do either mischief or good;
and it is probable that it has been added to poisons either
through ignorance, or to conceal other ingredients; for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
emperor Charles VI., who was king of the Two Sicilies at the
time when Tophania was arrested, told his physician Garelli,
who communicated the same in a <span class="locked">letter<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a></span> to the celebrated
Hoffmann, in 1718 or 1719, that the poison of that Italian
Circe was composed of an arsenical oxide, dissolved in <i>aqua
cymbalariæ</i>, and which I suppose was rendered stronger and
more difficult to be detected by a salt that may be readily
guessed. It is dreadful to think that this secret poison is administered
as a febrifuge by ignorant or unprincipled physicians,
quacks, and old women. It drives off obstinate fevers,
it is true; but it is equally certain that it hastens death: it is
therefore a cure, which is far worse than the disease, and
against which governments and physicians cannot exclaim too
severely. It was remarked at Rome, by accident, that lemon
juice and the acid of lemons are, in some measure, counter-poisons;
and a physician named Paul Branchaletti, respecting
whom I can find no information, wrote a book expressly on
this antidote to these drops, according to the account of Keysler,
who however adds, “Everything hitherto found out, supposes
that one has taken the drops only for a short time, or
that one has had an opportunity to be upon one’s guard when
suspicious circumstances occurred, and to discover the threatened
danger.”</p>

<p>It seems to be almost certain that the poisons prepared by
Tophania and Brinvillier were arsenical mixtures, or, as Dr.
<span class="locked">Hahneman<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a></span> rightly conjectures, neutral salts of arsenic. Loss
of appetite, faintness, gnawing pains in the stomach, loss of
strength without any visible cause, a continual indisposition,
followed by a wasting of the viscera, a slow fever, &amp;c., are all
symptoms which seem to announce that dangerous metallic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
oxide. The opinion, however, that it was composed of opium
and cantharides has, in latter times, received so many confirmations,
that one is almost induced to believe that there are
more kinds than one of this Stygian water. The information
given by the abbé Gagliani, seems to carry too much weight

but what he says of the use made of Spanish flies, by
the Chinese, to invigorate the sixth sense, gives reason to suspect
that his voucher is <i>L’Espion Dévalisé</i>, to whom the abbé
Gagliani ascribes the same words. It appears to me, however,
if I may be allowed to judge from probabilities, that the poison
known in the East Indies under the name of <i>powst</i> is also
water which has stood a night over the juice of poppies. It
is given in the morning fasting to those persons, and particularly
princes, whom people wish to despatch privately, and
without much violence. It consumes them slowly, so that
they at length lose all their strength and understanding, and
in the end die torpid and <span class="locked">insensible<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a></span>.</p>

<p>[Chemical science has made such rapid progress of late
years, that there are but few, if any, poisonous substances which
cannot be detected with certainty. The improved state of our
medical knowledge, and the institution of coroners’ inquests
in all cases where any suspicion of the cause of death occurs,
fortunately renders secret poisoning almost, if not quite impossible,
at least in this country.]</p>

Europe frequently mix quartz powder with their heavy food to assist in its
digestion; and we are informed by Professor Ehrenberg, that in times of
scarcity, the inhabitants of Lapland mix the siliceous shells of some species
of fossil Infusoria with the ground bark of trees for food. It is probably

laboratory of a certain prince on the confines of Bohemia, and who by the
orders (perhaps not very laudable) of his patron, has spent much time and
labour in strengthening and moderating poisons. He has often declared,
that of sugar of lead, with the addition of some more volatile corrosive, a
very slow poison could be prepared; which, if swallowed by a dog or other
animal, would insensibly destroy it, without any violent symptoms, in the
course of some weeks or months.”</p></div>

poison, which that infamous poisoner, still alive in prison at Naples, employed
to the destruction of upwards of six hundred persons. It was
nothing else than crystallised arsenic, dissolved in a large quantity of water
by decoction, with the addition, but for what purpose I know not, of the
herb cymbalaria. This was communicated to me by his imperial majesty
himself, to whom the judicial procedure, confirmed by the confession of
the criminal, was transmitted. This water, in the Neapolitan dialect, is
called <i>aqua del Toffnina</i>. It is certain death, and many have fallen a sacrifice
to it.”&mdash;Hoffmanni Med. Rationalis System., p. ii. c. 2. § 19.</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a name="Footnote_137" id="Footnote_137" href="#FNanchor_137" class="fnanchor">137</a>  On the 20th of December, 1765, died the dauphin, father of Louis XVI.,
and in 1767 died the dauphiness. It was a public report that they were
both despatched by secret poison: and the gradual decline of their health,
the other circumstances which accompanied their illness, and the cabals
which then existed at court, make this at least not improbable. Many
private anecdotes respecting these events may be found in a book entitled
L’Espion Dévalisé. Feliciter audax. London, 1782. In page 61 it is said,
that on account of the suspicions then entertained, it was wished that information
might be procured respecting secret poison, and the methods of
preparing it; and that the abbé Gagliani, well known as a writer, has given
the following:&mdash;“It is certain that in Europe the preparation of these
drugs renders them pernicious and mortal. For example, at Naples the
mixture of opium and cantharides, in known doses, is a slow poison; the
surest of all, and the more infallible as one cannot mistrust it. At first it
is given in small doses, that its effects may be insensible. In Italy we call
it <i>aqua di Tufania</i>, Tufania water. No one can avoid its attacks, because
the liquor obtained from that composition is as limpid as rock water, and
without taste. Its effects are slow and almost imperceptible: a few drops
of it only are poured into tea, chocolate, or soup, &amp;c. There is not a lady
at Naples who has not some of it lying carelessly on her toilette with her
smelling-bottles. She alone knows the phial, and can distinguish it. Even
the waiting-woman, who is her confidant, is not in the secret, and takes
this phial for distilled water, or water obtained by precipitation, which is
the purest, and which is used to moderate perfumes when they are too
strong.
</p>
<p>
“The effects of this poison are very simple. A general indisposition is
at first felt in the whole frame. The physician examines you, and perceiving
no symptoms of disease, either external or internal, no obstructions,
no collection of humours, no inflammations, orders detergents, regimen,
and evacuation. The dose of poison is then doubled, and the same indisposition
continues without being more characterized. The physician, who
can see in this nothing extraordinary, ascribes the state of the patient to
viscous and peccant humours, which have not been sufficiently carried off
by the first evacuation. He orders a second&mdash;a third dose&mdash;a third evacuation&mdash;a
fourth dose. The physician then sees that the disease has
escaped him; that he has mistaken it, and that the cause of it cannot be
discovered but by changing the regimen. He orders the waters, &amp;c. In
a word, the noble parts lose their tone, become relaxed and affected, and
the lungs particularly, as the most delicate of all, and one of those most
employed in the functions of the animal œconomy. The first illness then
carries you off; because the critical accumulation settles always on the
weak part, and consequently on the lobes of the lungs; the pus there fixes
itself, and the disease becomes incurable. By this method they follow one
as long as they choose for months, and for years. Robust constitutions
resist a long time. In short, it is not the liquor alone that kills, it is rather
the different remedies, which alter and then destroy the temperament, exhaust
the strength, extenuate and render one incapable of supporting the
first indisposition that comes.”</p></div>

<h2 id="wooden">WOODEN BELLOWS.</h2>

<p>After the discovery of fire, the first instrument employed to
blow it and strengthen it, has undoubtedly been a hollow
reed, until the art was found out of forming a stick into a pipe
by boring it. Our common bellows, which consist of two
boards joined together by a piece of leather, and which probably
are an imitation of the lungs, appear to have been early
known to the Greeks. I have, however, met with no passage
in any ancient author from which I could learn the oldest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
construction of this machine, which in latter times has received
many improvements. Had I found such information, I should
have endeavoured to explain it, as it would have contributed
to enlarge the knowledge we have of the metallurgy of the
ancients.</p>

<p>It may be remarked on the following lines of Virgil,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">... Alii taurinis follibus auras<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Accipiunt <span class="locked">redduntque<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a></span>....<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">that bull’s leather is unfit for bellows, and that ox or cow
leather only can be used for that purpose; but accuracy is
not to be expected in a poet; and besides, Virgil is not the
only author who employs the expression <i>folles taurinos</i>; for
Plautus says also, “Quam folles taurini habent, cum liquescunt
petræ, ferrum ubi fit.”</p>

<p>Strabo<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> tells us, from an old historian, that Anacharsis, the
Scythian philosopher, who lived in the time of Solon, invented
the bellows, the anchor, and the potter’s wheel: but this account
is very doubtful, as Pliny, <span class="locked">Seneca<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a></span>, Diogenes Laërtius<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a>,
and Suidas, who likewise speak of the inventions ascribed to
that philosopher, mention only the last two, and not the bellows:
besides, Strabo himself remarks that the potter’s wheel
is noticed in Homer, and this poet is certainly older than
Anacharsis. The latter, perhaps, became acquainted with
that useful instrument during the course of his travels, and
on his return, made his countrymen first acquainted with it.
However this may be, it is well known that the person who
introduces a foreign invention among a people, is often considered
as the author of it.</p>

<p>In the oldest smelting-houses the bellows were worked by
men. Refuse, therefore, and other remains of metal, are often
found in places where until a recent period no works could be
erected, on account of the want of water.</p>

<p>Bellows made with leather, of which I have hitherto spoken,
are attended with many inconveniences. They require careful
management; are expensive in their repairs; and besides
last often not more than six or seven years. If thin leather is
employed, it suffers a great deal of the air to escape through
it; an evil which must be guarded against by continually besmearing
it with train-oil, or other fat substances; and this is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
even necessary when thick leather is used, to prevent it from
cracking in the folds. Damage by fire and water must also
be avoided; and every time they are repaired, the leather
must be again softened with oil, which occasions a considerable
loss of time.</p>

<p>In wooden bellows these inconveniences are partly lessened,
and partly remedied. As these bellows, except the pipe, consist
entirely of wood, many, who are not acquainted with the
construction of them, can hardly conceive the possibility of
making such a machine. Though they cannot be properly
described without a figure, I shall endeavour to give the reader
some idea of them by the following short sketch. The whole
machine consists of two boxes placed the one upon the other,
the uppermost of which can be moved up and down upon the
lower one, in the same manner as the lid of a snuff-box, which
has a hinge, moves up and down when it is opened or shut;
but the sides of the uppermost box are so broad as to contain
the lower one between them, when it is raised to its utmost
extent. Both boxes are bound together, at the smallest end,
where the pipe is, by a strong iron bolt. It may be readily
comprehended, that when both boxes fit each other exactly,
and the upper one is raised over the under one, which is in a
state of rest, the space contained by both will be increased;
and consequently more air will rush in through the valve in
the bottom of the lower one; and when the upper box is again
forced down, this air will be expelled through the pipe. The
only difficulty is to prevent the air, which forces its way in,
from escaping anywhere else than through the pipe; for it is
not to be expected that the boxes will fit each other so closely
as to prevent entirely the air from making its way between
them. This difficulty, however, is obviated by the following
simple and ingenious method. On the inner sides of the uppermost
box there are placed moveable slips of wood, which,
by means of metal springs, are pressed to the sides of the
other box, and fill up the space between them. As these long
slips of wood might not be sufficiently pliable to suffer themselves
to be pressed close enough, and as, though planed perfectly
straight at first, they would in time become warped in
various directions, incisions are made in them across through
their whole length, at the distance of from fifteen to eighteen
inches from each other, so as to leave only a small space in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
their thickness, by which means they acquire sufficient pliability
to be everywhere pressed close enough to the <span class="locked">sides<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a></span>.</p>

<p>The advantages of these wooden bellows are very great.
When made of clean fir-wood without knots, they will last
thirty or forty years, and even longer, though continually kept
in action forty-six or forty-eight weeks every year: nay, Polhem
assures us, that, when properly made, they will last a
century. The effect produced by them is stronger, as well as
more uniform, and can be moderated according to circumstances.
They are worked also with greater facility. The
slips of wood on their sides are apt to become damaged; but
they can soon and easily be repaired. Every three or four
months, however, the outer sides only of the inner box, and
the bolt which keeps the boxes together, must be smeared with
oil. If we reckon up the price of such bellows, and the yearly
expense, they will, according to Grignon’s account, be only a
fifth part of those of the old leather bellows.</p>

<p>That the invention of these wooden bellows belongs to the
Germans, is certain. <span class="locked">Grignon<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a></span> expressly affirms so; and in
<span class="locked">Becher’s<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a></span> time they were to be found in Germany, but not in
England. Genssane, who ascribes the invention to the Swiss,
is certainly mistaken; and perhaps he was led into this error,
because these bellows were first made known in France by a
Swiss. I cannot, however, ascertain the name of the real inventor.
In the middle of the sixteenth century lived at Nuremberg
an artist called Hans Lobsinger, who, in the year
1550, gave to the magistrates of that city a catalogue of his
machines. From this catalogue Doppelmayer concludes that
he understood the art of making small and large bellows without
leather, and entirely of wood, which could be used in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
smelting-houses and for organs, and likewise copper bellows
that always emitted a like degree of wind. As Lobsinger
made organs, he, perhaps, fell upon this invention; but in
what it actually consisted, or whether it might not have died
with him, I have not been able to learn. Agricola, who died
in the year 1555, makes no mention of wooden bellows.</p>

<p>Samuel Reyher, formerly professor at Kiel, in a dissertation
on <span class="locked">air<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a></span>, printed there in 1669, tells us, that about forty years
before that period, two brothers, Martin and Nicholas Schelhorn,
millers at the village of Schmalebuche in Coburg, first
invented wooden bellows. Both the brothers, he says, kept
the invention secret, though he thinks they did not conceal it
so closely as to prevent its being guessed at; and he relates
also how he himself formed an idea of <span class="locked">it<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a></span>.</p>

<p>To these bellows Schluter has assigned a much nobler inventor,
who, perhaps, was the first person who made them
known by a description. He says expressly that they were
invented by a bishop of <span class="locked">Bamberg<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a></span>: but of this I have been
able to find no confirmation; and I am inclined to ascribe that
service rather to an organ-builder, or a miller, than to a bishop.
According to Schluter’s account, these bellows were employed
so early as the year 1620, in the Harz forest, to which they
were first brought by some people from Bamberg. What
Calvor says respecting the introduction of these bellows into
the Harz forest is much more probable; that in the year 1621<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
Lewis Pfannenschmid, from Thuringia, settled at Ostfeld near
Goslar, and began to make wooden bellows. The bellows-makers
of that place conspired therefore against him, and
swore they would put him to death; but he was protected by
the government. He would disclose his art to no one but his
son, who, as well as his grandson a few years ago, had the
making of all the bellows in the forest.</p>

<p>We are told by French authors, that the art of making these
bellows was introduced into France, particularly into Berry,
Nivernois, and Franche Comté, by a German.</p>

forty years before, which would be the year 1629 or 1630; but in an improved

Franconia. Two brothers, millers in that village, Martin and Nicholas
Schelhorn, by means of some box made by them, the lid of which fitted
very exactly, found out these chests, as I was told by one of their friends,
a man worthy of credit. These chests are not of leather, but entirely of

<h2 id="coaches">COACHES.</h2>

<p>If by this name we are to understand every kind of covered
carriage in which one can with convenience travel, there is
no doubt that some of them were known to the ancients. The
<i>arcera</i>, of which mention is made in the twelve tables, was a
covered carriage used by sick and infirm <span class="locked">persons<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a></span>. It appears
to have been employed earlier than the soft <i>lectica</i>, and
by it to have been brought into disuse. A later invention
is the <i>carpentum</i>, the form of which may be seen on antique
coins, where it is represented as a two-wheeled car with an
arched covering, and which was sometimes hung with costly
<span class="locked">cloth<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a></span>. Still later were introduced the <i>carrucæ</i>, first mentioned
by Pliny; but so little is known of them, that antiquaries
are uncertain whether they had only one wheel, like our
wheelbarrows, or, as is more probable, four wheels. This
much, however, is known, that they were first-rate vehicles,
ornamented with gold and precious stones, and that the
Romans considered it as an honour to ride in those that were
remarkably <span class="locked">high<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a></span>. In the Theodosian code the use of them
is not only allowed to civil and military officers of the first
rank, but commanded as a mark of their <span class="locked">dignity<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
After this, covered carriages seem more and more to have
become appendages of Roman pomp and magnificence; but
the manner of thinking which prevailed under the feudal system
banished the use of them for some time. As it was of
the greatest importance to the feudal lords that their vassals
should be always able to serve them on horseback, they could
not think of indulging them with elegant carriages. They
foresaw that by such luxury the nobility would give over
riding on horseback, and become much more indolent and
less fit for military service. Masters and servants, husbands
and wives, clergy and laity, all rode upon horses or mules,
and sometimes women and monks upon she-asses, which they
found more convenient. The minister rode to court, and the
horse, without any conductor, returned alone to his stable, till
a servant carried him back to court to fetch his master. In
this manner the magistrates of the imperial cities rode to council
in the beginning of the sixteenth century; so that in the
year 1502 steps to assist in mounting were erected by the
Roman gate at <span class="locked">Frankfort<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a></span>. The members of the council who,
at the diet and on other occasions, were employed as ambassadors,
were on this account called <i>Rittmeister</i>; and even at
present the expression <i>riding servant</i> is preserved in some of
the imperial cities. The public entry of great lords into any
place, or their departure from it, was never in a carriage, but
on horseback; and in all the works which speak of the papal
ceremonies there is no mention of a state coach or body
coachmen, but of state horses or state mules. It was necessary
that a horse for his holiness should be of a gray colour;
not mettlesome however, but a quiet, tractable nag; that a
stool with three steps should be brought to assist him to
mount, and the emperor and kings, if present, were obliged
to hold his stirrup and to lead the <span class="locked">horse<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a></span>, &amp;c. Bishops made
their public entrance on horses or asses richly <span class="locked">decorated<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a></span>.
At the coronation of the emperor, the electors and principal
officers of the empire were ordered to make their entrance on
horses, and to perform their service on <span class="locked">horseback<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a></span>. Formerly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
it was requisite that those who received an investiture should
make their appearance on horseback: the vassal was obliged
to ride with two attendants to his lord’s court, where, having
dismounted from his horse, he received his fief.</p>

<p>Covered carriages were known in the beginning of the sixteenth
century; but they were used only by women of the
first rank, for the men thought it disgraceful to ride in them.
At that period, when the electors and princes did not choose
to be present at the meetings of the states, they excused themselves
by informing the emperor that their health would not
permit them to ride on horseback; and it was considered as
an established point, that it was unbecoming for them to ride
like <span class="locked">women<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a></span>. What, according to the then prevailing ideas,
was not allowed to princes, was much less permitted to their
servants. In the year 1544, when Count Wolf of Barby was
summoned by John Frederic, elector of Saxony, to go to
Spires to attend the convention of the states assembled there,
he requested leave, on account of his ill state of health, to
make use of a close carriage with four horses. When the
counts and nobility were invited to the marriage solemnity of
the elector’s half brother, duke John Ernest, the invitation
was accompanied with a memorandum, that such dresses of
ceremony as they might be desirous of taking with them should
be transported in a small <span class="locked">waggon<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a></span>. Had they been expected
in coaches, such a memorandum would have been superfluous.
The use of covered carriages was for a long time forbidden
even to women. In the year 1545 the wife of a certain duke
obtained from him, with great difficulty, permission to use a
covered carriage in a journey to the baths, in which however
much pomp was displayed, but with this express stipulation,
that her attendants should not have the same <span class="locked">indulgence<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a></span>.
It is nevertheless certain, that the emperor, kings and princes,
about the end of the fifteenth century, began to employ covered
carriages on journeys, and afterwards on public solemnities.</p>

<p>In the year 1474 the emperor Frederic III. came to Frankfort
in a close carriage; and as he remained in it on account
of the wetness of the weather, the inhabitants had no occasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
to support the canopy which was held over him, but while he
went to the council-house, and again returned. In the year
following the emperor visited the same city in a very magnificent
covered carriage. In the description of the splendid
tournament held by Joachim, elector of Brandenburg, at
Ruppin, in 1509, we read of a carriage gilt all over, which
belonged to the electress; of twelve other coaches ornamented
with crimson, and of another of the duchess of Mecklenburg,
which was hung with red satin. At the coronation of the
emperor Maximilian, in the year 1562, the elector of Cologne
had twelve carriages. In 1594, when the margrave John Sigismund
did homage at Warsaw on account of Prussia, he
had in his train thirty-six coaches with six horses <span class="locked">each<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a></span>.
Count Kevenhiller, speaking of the marriage of the emperor
Ferdinand II. with a princess of Bavaria, says, “The bride
rode with her sisters in a splendid carriage studded with gold;
her maids of honour in carriages hung with black satin, and
the rest of the ladies in neat leather carriages.” The same
author mentions the entrance of Cardinal Dietrichstein into
Vienna in 1611, and tells us that forty carriages went to meet
<span class="locked">him<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a></span>. At the election of the emperor Matthias, the ambassador
of Brandenburg had three <span class="locked">coaches<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a></span>. When the consort
of that emperor made her public entrance, on her marriage
in 1611, she rode in a carriage covered with perfumed
leather. Mary, infanta of Spain, spouse of the emperor Ferdinand
III., rode, in Carinthia, in 1631, in a glass carriage in
which no more than two persons could sit. The wedding
carriage of the first wife of the emperor Leopold, who was
also a Spanish princess, cost together with the harness 38,000
<span class="locked">florins<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a></span>. The coaches used by that emperor are thus described
by Rink:&mdash;“In the imperial coaches no great magnificence
was to be seen: they were covered over with red cloth and
black nails. The harness was black, and in the whole work
there was no gold. The pannels were of glass, and on this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
account they were called the imperial glass coaches. On festivals
the harness was ornamented with red silk fringes. The
imperial coaches were distinguished only by their having
leather traces; but the ladies in the imperial suite were obliged
to be contented with carriages the traces of which were made
of ropes.” At the magnificent court of duke Ernest Augustus
at Hanover, there were, in the year 1681, fifty gilt coaches
with six horses <span class="locked">each<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a></span>. So early did Hanover begin to surpass
other cities in the number of its carriages. The first time
that ambassadors appeared in coaches on a public solemnity
was at the imperial commission held at Erfurth in 1613, respecting
the affair of <span class="locked">Juliers<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a></span>.</p>

<p>The great lords at first imagined that they could suppress
the use of coaches by prohibitions. In the archives of the
county of Mark there is still preserved an edict, in which the
feudal nobility and vassals are forbid the use of coaches, under
pain of incurring the punishment of felony. In the year
1588, duke Julius of Brunswick published an order, couched
in very expressive terms, by which his vassals were forbid to
ride in carriages. This curious document is in substance as
follows:&mdash;“As we know from ancient historians, from the
annals of heroic, honourable and glorious achievements, and
even by our own experience, that the respectable, steady,
courageous and spirited Germans were heretofore so much
celebrated among all nations on account of their manly virtue,
sincerity, boldness, honesty and resolution, that their assistance
was courted in war, and that in particular the people of
this land, by their discipline and intrepidity, both within and
without the kingdom, acquired so much celebrity, that foreign
nations readily united with them; we have for some time past
found, with great pain and uneasiness, that their useful discipline
and skill in riding, in our electorate, county and lordship,
have not only visibly declined, but have been almost lost
(and no doubt other electors and princes have experienced
the same among their nobility); and as the principal cause of
this is that our vassals, servants and kinsmen, without distinction,
young and old, have dared to give themselves up to
indolence and to riding in coaches, and that few of them provide
themselves with well-equipped riding horses and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
skilful experienced servants, and boys acquainted with the
roads: not being able to suffer any longer this neglect, and
being desirous to revive the ancient Brunswick mode of riding,
handed down and bequeathed to us by our forefathers, we
hereby will and command, that all and each of our before-mentioned
vassals, servants and kinsmen, of whatever rank or
condition, shall always keep in readiness as many riding-horses
as they are obliged to serve us with by their fief or alliance;
and shall have in their service able, experienced servants, acquainted
with the roads; and that they shall have as many
horses as possible with polished steel harness and with saddles
proper for carrying the necessary arms and accoutrements,
so that they may appear with them when necessity requires.
We also will and command our before-mentioned
vassals and servants to take notice, that when we order them
to assemble, either altogether or in part, in times of turbulence
or to receive their fiefs, or when on other occasions they visit
our court, they shall not travel or appear in coaches, but on
their riding-horses, &amp;c.”<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a> Philip II., duke of Pomerania-Stettin,
reminded his vassals also, in 1608, that they ought not
to make so much use of carriages as of <span class="locked">horses<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a></span>. All these
orders and admonitions however were of no avail, and coaches
became common all over Germany.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to give an exact description of these
carriages without a figure, and drawings or paintings of them
do not seem to be common.</p>

<p>In the month of October 1785, when I visited the senate-house
at Bremen, I saw in the tax-chamber a view of the city,
painted on the wall in oil colours, by John Landwehr, in 1661.
On the left side of the fore-ground I observed a long quadrangular
carriage, which did not appear to be suspended by
leather straps. It was covered with a canopy supported by
four pillars, but had no curtains, so that one could see all the
persons who were in it. In the side there was a small door,
and before there seemed to be a low seat, or perhaps a box.
The coachman sat upon the horses. It was evident, from
their dress, that the persons in it were burgomasters.</p>

<p>In the history of France we find many proofs that at Paris,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
in the fourteenth, fifteenth, and even sixteenth centuries, the
French monarchs rode commonly on horses, the servants of
the court on mules, and the princesses, together with the principal
ladies, sometimes on asses. Persons of the first rank
frequently sat behind their equerry, and the horse was often
led by servants. When Charles VI. wished to see incognito
the entrance of the queen, he placed himself on horseback
behind Savoisy, who was his confidant, with whom, however,
he was much incommoded in the <span class="locked">crowd<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a></span>. When Louis, duke
of Orleans, that prince’s brother, was assassinated in 1407,
the two <i>ecuyers</i> who accompanied him rode both upon the
same <span class="locked">horse<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a></span>. In the year 1534, queen Eleonora and the
princesses rode on white horses (<i>des haquenées blanches</i>)
during a sacred festival. That private persons also, such as
physicians, for example, used no carriages in the fifteenth century,
is proved by the principal entrance to their public school,
which was built in 1472, being so narrow that a carriage could
not pass through it, though it was one of the widest at that
period. In Paris also, at all the palaces and public buildings,
there were steps for mounting on horseback, such as those
which the parliament caused to be erected in 1599; and Sauval
says on this occasion, that though many of these steps in
latter periods had been taken away, there still remained several
of them in his time at old buildings.</p>

<p>Carriages, however, appear to have been used very early
in France. An ordinance of Philip the Fair, issued in 1294,
for suppressing luxury, and in which the citizens’ wives are
forbid to use carriages (<i>cars</i>), is still <span class="locked">preserved<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a></span>. Under
Francis I., or about 1550, somewhat later, there were at Paris,
for the first time, only three coaches, one of which belonged
to the queen, another to Diana de Poictiers, the mistress of
two kings, Francis I. and Henry II., by the latter of whom
she was created duchess of Valentinois, and the third to
René de Laval, lord of Bois-dauphin. The last was a corpulent
unwieldy nobleman, who was not able to ride on horseback.
Others say, that the first three coaches belonged to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
Catherine de Medici; Diana, duchess of Angoulême, the natural
daughter of Henry II., who died in 1619, in the eightieth
year of her age; and Christopher de Thou, first president of the
parliament. The last was excused by the gout; but the rest of
the ministers of state soon followed his <span class="locked">example<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a></span>. Henry IV.
was assassinated in a coach; but he usually rode through the
streets of Paris on horseback, and to provide against rain,
carried a large cloak behind him. For himself and his queen
he had only one coach; as appears by a letter still preserved,
in which he writes to a friend, “I cannot wait upon you today,
because my wife is using my <span class="locked">coach<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a></span>.” We, however,
find two coaches at the public solemnity on the arrival of the
Spanish ambassador, Don Peter de Toledo, under Henry <span class="locked">IV.<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a></span>
This contradiction is not worth further research; but it shows
that all writers do not speak of the same kind of carriages or
coaches, and that every improvement has formed as it were an
epoch in the history of them, which perhaps would be best
elucidated by figures or engravings.</p>

<p>Roubo, in his costly Treatise on joiners’ <span class="locked">work<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a></span>, has given
three figures of such (<i>chars</i>) carriages as were used under
Henry IV., from drawings preserved in the king’s library.
By these it is seen that those coaches were not suspended by
straps, that they had a canopy supported by ornamented pillars,
and that the whole body was surrounded by curtains of
stuff or leather, which could be drawn up. The coach in
which Louis XIV. made his public entrance, about the middle
of the seventeenth century, appears, from a drawing in the
king’s library, to have been a suspended carriage.</p>

<p>The oldest carriages used by the ladies in England were
known under the now-forgotten name of <i>whirlicotes</i>. When
Richard II., towards the end of the fourteenth century, was
obliged to fly before his rebellious subjects, he and all his followers
were on horseback; his mother only, who was indisposed,
rode in a carriage. This, however, became afterwards
somewhat unfashionable, when that monarch’s queen, Ann, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
daughter of the emperor Charles IV., showed the English ladies
how gracefully and conveniently she could ride on a side-saddle.
Whirlicotes therefore were disused, except at coronations and
other public <span class="locked">solemnities<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a></span>. Coaches were first known in England
about the year 1580, and, as Stow says, were introduced
from Germany by Fitz-allen, earl of <span class="locked">Arundel<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a></span>. In
the year 1598, when the English ambassador came to Scotland,
he had a coach with <span class="locked">him<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a></span>. Anderson places the period
when coaches began to be in common use, about the year
1605. The celebrated duke of Buckingham, the unworthy
favourite of two kings, was the first person who rode with
a coach and six horses, in 1619. To ridicule this new
pomp, the earl of Northumberland put eight horses to his
carriage.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the thirteenth century, when Charles
of Anjou made his entrance into Naples, the queen rode in a
carriage, called by historians <i>caretta</i>, the outside and inside
of which were covered with sky-blue velvet, interspersed with
golden lilies, a magnificence never before seen by the Neapolitans.
At the entrance of Frederic II. into Padua, in the
year 1239, it appears that there were no carriages, for the
most elegantly dressed ladies who came to meet him were on
palfreys ornamented with trappings (<i>sedentes in phaleratis et
ambulantibus palafredis</i>). It is well known that the luxury
of carriages spread from Naples all over Italy.</p>

<p>Coaches were seen for the first time in Spain in the year
1546. Such at least is the account of Twiss, who, according
to his usual custom, says so without giving his <span class="locked">authority<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a></span>.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the sixteenth century, John of Finland,
on his return from England, among other articles of luxury,
brought with him to Sweden the first <span class="locked">coach<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a></span>. Before that
period, the greatest lords in Sweden, when they travelled by
land, carried their wives with them on horseback. The princesses
even travelled in that manner, and, when it rained, took
with them a mantle of wax-cloth.</p>

<p>It appears that there were elegant coaches in the capital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
of Russia so early as the beginning of the seventeenth <span class="locked">century<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a></span>.</p>

<p>But to what nation ought we to ascribe the invention of
coaches? If under this name we comprehend covered carriages,
these are so old as not to admit of any dispute respecting
the question. To the following, however, one might expect
an answer, Who first fell on the idea of suspending the
body of the carriage from elastic springs, by which the whole
machine has undoubtedly been much improved? To this
question, however, I can find no answer, except the information
before-mentioned, that suspended carriages were known
in the time of Louis XIV.</p>

<p>As the name coach is now adopted, with a little variation,
in all the European languages, some have thought to determine
the country of this invention from the etymology of the
<span class="locked">word<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a></span>. But even allowing that one could fix the origin of
the word, it would by no means be ascertained what kind of
a carriage we ought properly to understand by it. M. <span class="locked">Cornides<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a></span>
has lately endeavoured to prove that the word <i>coach</i> is
of Hungarian extraction, and that it had its rise from a village
in the province of Wieselburg, which at present is called
<i>Kitsee</i>, but was known formerly by the name of <i>Kotsee</i>, and
that this travelling machine was even there first invented.
However this may be, the grounds on which he supports his
assertion deserve to be here quoted, as they seem at least to
prove that in the sixteenth century, or even earlier, a kind of
covered carriages was known, under the name of Hungarian
<span class="locked">carriages<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a></span>. As the word <i>Gutschi</i>, and not <i>Gutsche</i>, was used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
at first in Germany, the last syllable gives us reason to conjecture
that it is rather of Hungarian than German extraction.
As <span class="locked">Hortleder<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a></span> tells us that Charles V., because he had
the gout, laid himself to sleep in an Hungarian <i>Gutsche</i>, one
might almost conclude that the peculiarity of these carriages
consisted in their being so constructed as to admit people to
sleep in them. This conjecture is supported by the meaning
of the word <i>Gutsche</i>, which formerly signified a couch or
<span class="locked">sofa<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a></span>. As the writers quoted by Cornides call the Hungarian
coaches sometimes (<i>leves</i>) light, sometimes (<i>veloces</i>) swift,
they ought rather to be considered as a particular kind of
carriages for travelling with expedition. It is, however, still
more worthy of remark, that, so early as the year 1457, the
ambassador of Ladislaus V., king of Hungary and Bohemia,
brought with him to the queen of France, besides other presents,
a carriage which excited great wonder at Paris, and
which, as an old historian says, was <i>branlant et moult riche</i><a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a>.
Does not the first word of this expression seem to indicate
that the carriage was suspended?</p>

<p>A peculiar kind of coach has been introduced in latter times
under the name of Berlin. The name indicates the place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
which gave birth to the invention, as the French themselves
acknowledge; though some, with very little probability, wish
to derive it from the <span class="locked">Italian<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a></span>. Philip de Chiese, a native of
Piedmont, and descended from the Italian family of Chiesa,
was a colonel and quarter-master-general in the service of
Frederic William, elector of Brandenburg, by whom he was
much esteemed on account of his knowledge in architecture.
Being once sent to France on his master’s business, he caused
to be built, on purpose for this journey, a carriage capable of
containing two persons; which, in France and everywhere
else, was much approved, and called a berline. This Philip
de Chiese died at Berlin in <span class="locked">1673<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a></span>.</p>

<p>Coaches have given rise to a profession which in large
cities affords maintenance to a great number of people, and
which is attended with much convenience; I mean that of
letting out coaches for hire, known under the name of <i>fiacres</i>,
<span class="locked">hackney-coaches<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a></span>. This originated in France; for about the
year 1650 one Nicholas Sauvage first thought of keeping
horses and carriages ready to be let out to those who might
have occasion for them. The Parisians approved of and
patronised this plan; and as Sauvage lived in the street St.
Martin, in a house called the <i>hôtel St. Fiacre</i>, the coaches,
coachmen and proprietor, were called <i>fiacres</i>. In a little
time this undertaking was improved by others, who obtained
a license for their new institutions on paying a certain sum of
<span class="locked">money<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a></span>. Some kept coaches ready in certain places of the
streets, and let them out as long as was required, to go from
one part of the city to another. These alone, at length, retained
the name of <i>fiacre</i>, which at first was common to every
kind of hired carriage without distinction. Others kept carriages
at their houses, which they let out for a half or a whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
day, a week, or a month: these coaches were known by the
name of <i>carosses de remise</i>. Others kept carriages which at
a certain stated time went from one quarter of the city to another,
like a kind of stages, and took up such passengers as
presented themselves; and in the year 1662 some persons set
up carriages with four horses, for the purpose of conveying
people to the different palaces at which the court might be;
these were called <i>voitures pour la suite de la cour</i>. The proprietors
often quarreled respecting the boundaries prescribed
to them by their licenses; and on this account they were sometimes
united into one company, and sometimes separated. The
police established useful regulations, by which the safety and
cleanliness of these carriages were promoted; marks were
affixed to them, by which they might be known; and young
persons and women of the town were forbidden to use
<span class="locked">them<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a></span>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>A particular kind of hackney carriage, peculiar to the
Parisians, in the opinion of some does no great honour to
their urbanity. I mean the <i>brouettes</i>, called sometimes <i>roulettes</i>,
and by way of derision <i>vinaigrettes</i>. The body of these
is almost like that of our sedans, but rolls upon two low
wheels, and is dragged forwards by men. An attempt was
made to introduce such machines under Louis XIII.; but the
proprietors of the sedans prevented it, as they apprehended
the ruin of their business. In the year 1669 they were however
permitted, and came into common use in 1671, but were
employed only by the common people. Dupin, the inventor
of these <i>brouettes</i>, found means to contrive them so that they
did not jolt so much as might have been expected; and he
was able to conceal this art so well, that for a long time he
was the only person who could make <span class="locked">them<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a></span>. The number
of all the coaches at Paris is by some said to be fifteen thousand;
the author of Tableau de Paris reckons the number of
the hackney coaches to amount to eighteen hundred, and asserts
that more than a hundred foot passengers lose their lives
by them every year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
Coaches to be let for hire were first established at London
in 1625. At that time there were only twenty, which did not
stand in the streets, but at the principal inns. Ten years after,
however, they were become so numerous, that king Charles I.
found it necessary to issue an order for limiting their number.
In the year 1637 there were in London and Westminster fifty
hackney coaches, for each of which no more than twelve
horses were to be kept. In the year 1652 their number had
increased to two hundred; in 1654 there were three hundred,
for which six hundred horses were employed; in 1694 they
were limited to seven hundred, and in 1715 to eight <span class="locked">hundred<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a></span>.</p>

<p>Hackney coaches were first established in Edinburgh in
1673. Their number was twenty; but as the situation of the
city was unfavourable for carriages, it fell in 1752 to fourteen,
and in 1778 to nine, and the number of sedans increased.</p>

<p><i>Fiacres</i> were introduced at Warsaw, for the first time, in
1778. In Copenhagen there are a hundred hackney <span class="locked">coaches<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a></span>.</p>

<p>In Madrid there are from four to five thousand gentlemen’s
<span class="locked">carriages<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a></span>; in Vienna three thousand, and two hundred hackney
coaches.</p>

<p>At Amsterdam coaches with wheels were in the year 1663
forbidden, in order to save the expensive pavement of the
streets; for coaches there, even in summer, are placed upon
sledges, as those at Petersburgh are in winter. The tax upon
carriages in Holland has from time to time been raised, yet
the number has increased; and some years ago the coach
horses in the Seven United Provinces amounted to twenty-five
thousand.</p>

<p>When Prince Repnin made his entrance into Constantinople
in 1775, he had with him eighty coaches, and two hundred
livery servants.</p>

<p>[Since the former edition of this work, published in 1814,
public conveyances have undergone considerable changes.
Stage-coaches, which in this country had arrived at such
a degree of perfection, and which, till within a few years,
passed through and connected almost every small town in
the United Kingdom, have now nearly disappeared in consequence
of the introduction of railroads. It is also rare in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
London to meet with a solitary hackney coach, this class of
vehicles being almost entirely superseded by the lighter one-horsed
cabriolets which were first introduced as public conveyances
in the year 1823. The number of hackney coaches
and cabriolets now plying for hire in the streets of London
amounts to 2650, of which probably not more than 250 are
two-horsed coaches.</p>

<p>That very useful form of public conveyance, the omnibus,
which is at present met with in nearly every large town in Europe,
originated in Paris in 1827. In the latter part of 1831 and
the beginning of 1832, omnibuses began to ply in the streets
of London. Those running from Paddington to the Bank
were the earliest. Carriages, however, of a similar form were
used in England as Long Stages more than forty years ago,
but were discontinued as they were not found profitable.
They were in most request at holiday time, by schoolmasters
in the neighbourhood of London; and some even of the present
generation will remember their joyous pranks on journeying
home in these capacious machines.</p>

<p>There are now about 900 omnibuses running in London
and its immediate vicinity. The line from Paddington to the
Bank is served by two companies, the London Conveyance
Company, and the Paddington Association, which have mutually
agreed to run forty omnibuses each. An idea of the
utility of these conveyances may be formed from the fact that
the receipts of each of the eighty carriages on the above line
averages 1000<i>l.</i> per annum, in sixpences.</p>

<p>Omnibuses began to run in Amsterdam in 1839.]</p>

not contented with informing the king by letter of this event, he
speedily got into one of those light carriages, which, from the name of the

mentions some stages in Hungary, “The fourth stage for stopping

<h2 id="water">WATER-CLOCKS, CLEPSYDRAS.</h2>

<p>We are well assured that the ancients had machines by which,
through the help of water, they were able to measure <span class="locked">time<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a></span>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
The invention of them is by <span class="locked">Vitruvius<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a></span> ascribed to Ctesibius
of Alexandria, who lived under Ptolemy Euergetes, or about
the year 245 before the Christian æra<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a>. They were introduced
at Rome by P. Cornelius Scipio Nasica, in the year 594 after
the building of the city, or about 157 years before the birth
of Christ. How these water-clocks were constructed, or
whether they were different from the clepsydras, I shall not
inquire. If under the latter name we understand those measurers
of time which were used in courts of justice, the clepsydra
is a Grecian invention, first adopted at Rome under
the third consulship of <span class="locked">Pompey<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a></span>. The most common kinds
of these water-clocks all, however, corresponded in this, that
the water issued drop by drop through a hole of the vessel, and
fell into another, in which a light body that floated marked
the height of the water as it rose, and, by these means, the
time that had elapsed. They all had this failing in common,
that the water at first flowed out rapidly, and afterwards more
slowly, so that they required much care and <span class="locked">regulation<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a></span>.</p>

<p>That ingenious machine, which we have at present under
the name of a water-clock, was invented in the seventeenth
century. The precise time seems to be uncertain; but had it
been before the year <span class="locked">1643<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a></span>, Kircher, who mentions all the
machines of this kind then known, would in all probability
have taken notice of it. It consists of a cylinder divided into
several small cells, and suspended by a thread fixed to its axis
in a frame on which the hour distances, found by trial, are
marked out. As the water flows from the one cell into the
other, it changes very slowly the centre of gravity of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
cylinder, and puts it in <span class="locked">motion<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a></span>; much like the quicksilver
puppets invented by the <span class="locked">Chinese<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a></span>.</p>

<p>These machines must have been very scarce in France in
1691; for Graverol at that time gave a figure and description
of the external parts of one, but promised to give the internal
construction as soon as he should become acquainted with <span class="locked">it<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a></span>.
This was the only one then in Nismes. He says, also, that
they were invented a little before by an Italian Jesuit, who
resided at Bologna, but were brought to perfection by Taliaisson,
professor of law at Toulouse, and a young clergyman
named De l’Isle.</p>

<p>Alexander says more than once that this machine was invented
at Sens in Burgundy, in 1690, by Dom Charles Vailly,
a Benedictine of the brotherhood of St. Maur, and that he
brought it to perfection by the assistance of a pewterer there,
named Regnard. This account is in some measure confirmed
by Ozanam; for he says expressly, that the first water-clocks
were brought from Burgundy to Paris in 1693, and he describes
one which was made of tin at Sens. Dom Charles
Vailly was born at Paris in 1646, and died in 1726; he was
celebrated on account of his mathematical knowledge, though
he is known by no works, as he burned all his <span class="locked">manuscripts<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a></span>.</p>

<p>Alexander, however, who was of the same order, seems to
have ascribed to his brother Benedictine an honour to which
he was not entitled; for Dominic Martinelli, an Italian of
Spoletto, published at Venice, in 1663, a treatise written expressly
on these water-clocks, which Ozanam got translated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
into French by one of his friends, and caused to be printed
with his <span class="locked">additions<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a></span>. This translator says that water-clocks
were known in France twenty years earlier than Ozanam
had imagined. It appears therefore that they were invented
in Italy about the middle of the seventeenth century, and
that Vailly, perhaps, may have first made them known in
<span class="locked">France<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a></span>.</p>

<p>It may perhaps afford some pleasure to those who are fond
of the history of the arts, to know that Salmon, an ingenious
pewterer at Chartres in France, has given very full and ample
directions how to construct and use this <span class="locked">machine<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a></span>. He is of
opinion that the invention is scarcely a century old; and that
these water-clocks, which are now common, were first made
for sale and brought into use among the people in the country,
by a pewterer at Sens in Burgundy. What this artist
affirms, that they can be constructed of no metal so easily, so
accurately, and to last so long as of tin, is perfectly true. I
have however in my possession one of brass, which is well
constructed; but it suffers a little from acids. Among the
newest improvements to this machine may be reckoned an
alarum, which consists of a bell and small wheels, like those of
a clock that strikes the hours, screwed to the top of the frame
in which the cylinder is suspended. The axis of the cylinder,
at the hour when one is desirous of being wakened, pushes
down a small crank, which, by letting fall a weight, puts the
alarum in motion. A dial-plate with a handle is also placed
sometimes over the frame.</p>

<p>[A very ingenious application of the principle of the clepsydra,
for the purpose of measuring accurately very small
intervals of time, is due to the late Captain H. Kater. Mercury
is allowed to flow from a small orifice in the bottom of a
vessel, kept constantly filled to a certain height. At the moment
of noting any event, the stream is interrupted and turned
aside into a receiver, into which it continues to run till the
moment of noting any other event, when the intercepting
cause is suddenly removed. The stream then flows in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
original course. The weight of mercury in the receiver, compared
with the weight of that which passes through the orifice
in a given time, observed by the clock, gives the interval between
the events.]</p>

<h2 id="tourmaline">TOURMALINE.</h2>

<p>The ancients, though ignorant of electricity, were acquainted
with the nature of amber, and knew that when rubbed it had
the power of attracting light bodies. In like manner they
might have been acquainted with the tourmaline, and might
have known that it also, when heated, attracted light bodies,
and again repelled them; for had they only bethought themselves,
in order to search out the hidden properties of this
stone (which on account of its colour and hardness is very
remarkable), to put it into the fire, they would have then seen
it sport with the ashes. Some learned men have thought
they found traces of the properties of this stone, in what the
ancients tell us respecting the <i>lyncurium</i>, <i>theamedes</i>, and <i>carbunculus</i>.
The fruit of my researches respecting this subject
I shall here lay before the reader. All that we find in the
ancients to enable us to characterize the lyncurium is, that it
was a very hard stone, which could with difficulty be cut; that
seals were formed of it; that it was transparent, and of a fiery
colour, almost like that of yellow amber; that it attracted
light bodies, such as chaff, shavings of wood, leaves, feathers,
and bits of thin iron and copper leaf, in the same manner as
amber; that the ancients procured it from Æthiopia, but that
in the time of Pliny no stone was known under that <span class="locked">name<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a></span>.</p>

<p>This information proves, in my opinion, that the lyncurium
cannot be the belemnites, as some old commentators and
Woodward have affirmed; for the latter has not the celebrated
hardness and transparency of the former, neither has it the
property of attracting light bodies, nor is it fit for being cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
into seals. That opinion probably has arisen in the following
manner:&mdash;the ancients supposed that the lyncurium was the
crystallized urine of the animal which we call the lynx. As
some belemnites contain bituminous particles which give them
an affinity to the swine-stone, naturalists, when they have
rubbed or heated yellow and somewhat transparent pieces of
this fossil, have imagined that they smelt the fabulous origin
of the lyncurium.</p>

<p>Less ridiculous is the opinion of some old and modern
writers, that the lyncurium was a species of amber. Theophrastus,
however, the ablest and most accurate mineralogist
of the ancients, would certainly have remarked this and not
have separated the lyncurium from amber. Besides, the latter
has not the hardness of the former, nor can it be said that
it is difficult to be cut; for at present it is often made into
various toys with much ingenuity. The opinion of Pliny is
here of little weight; for it is founded, as ours must be, on
the information of Theophrastus.</p>

<p>Epiphanius, who considered the Bible as a system of mineralogy,
but could not find the lyncurium in it, supposes that it
may have been the <span class="locked">hyacinth<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a></span>. However ridiculous the cause
of this conjecture may be, it must be allowed that it is not
entirely destitute of probability; and I say with John de Laet,
“The description of the lyncurium does not ill agree with the
hyacinth of the <span class="locked">moderns<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a></span>.” If we consider its attracting of
small bodies in the same light as that power which our hyacinth
has in common with all stones of the glassy species, I
cannot see anything to controvert this opinion, and to induce
us to believe the lyncurium and the tourmaline to be the same.
The grounds which Watson produces for this supposition, are
more in favour of the hyacinth than the <span class="locked">tourmaline<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a></span>. Had
Theophrastus been acquainted with the latter, he would certainly
have remarked that it did not acquire its attractive
power till it was heated. At present, at least, no tourmaline
is known to attract until it is heated; though it would not
appear very wonderful if a stone like the magnet should retain
its virtue for a long time.</p>

<p>The duke of Noya Caraffa believes the theamedes of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
ancients to have been the <span class="locked">tourmaline<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a></span>. Of that stone we are
told, by Pliny, only that it possessed a power contrary to the
power of the magnet; that is, that it did not attract but repel
iron. But this only proves, that it had then been remarked
that the magnet repelled the negative pole of a piece of magnetic
iron. This account has been thus explained by <span class="locked">Boot<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a></span>.
To induce us to consider the theamedes as the tourmaline,
Pliny ought to have said that it attracted iron and then repelled
it.</p>

<p>With much greater probability may we consider as the tourmaline
a precious stone, classed by Pliny among the numerous
varieties of the <span class="locked">carbuncle<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a></span>; for however perplexed and
unintelligible his account of the carbuncles may be, and however
much the readings in the different copies may vary, we
still know that he describes a stone which was very hard;
which was of a purple, that is a dark violet colour, and used
for seals; and which, when heated by the beams of the sun, or
by friction, attracted chaff and other light bodies. Had Pliny
told us that it at first attracted and then repelled them, no
doubt would remain; but he does not say so, nor do his transcribers
Solinus and <span class="locked">Isidorus<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a></span>.</p>

<p>A much later account of a stone that, when rubbed, is, like
the magnet, endued with an attractive power is to be found
in a passage of John Serapion, the Arabian, pointed out to
me by Professor Bütner<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a>. This stone indeed cannot with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
much probability be taken for the tourmaline, as all precious
stones, when heated, have the same property; but it is worthy
of remark, that, like the lyncurium of the ancients, it belongs
to the hyacinths, the colour of which many of the real
tourmalines have; and among those of the island of Ceylon
there are, perhaps, some which ought to be classed among
the hyacinths, rather than among the schorls.</p>

<p>The real tourmaline was first brought from Ceylon, and
made known by the Dutch, about the end of the seventeenth
or beginning of the eighteenth century. It is commonly believed
that the first account of it ever published is that to be
found in the Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences at Paris
for the year 1717; but it appears that fuller and more accurate
descriptions of the properties of that stone were given in
German works ten years before. The earliest information
that I know respecting it is in a book now almost and justly
forgotten, entitled Curious Speculations during Sleepless
<span class="locked">Nights<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a></span>. In a passage, where the author, speaking of hard
and glassy bodies which attract light substances, affirms that
this property is not magnetic, he says, “The ingenious Dr.
Daumius, chief physician to the Polish and Saxon troops on
the Rhine, told me, that in the year 1703 the Dutch first
brought from Ceylon in the East Indies a precious stone called
tourmaline, or turmale, and named also <i>trip</i>, which had the
property, that it not only attracted the ashes from the warm
or burning coals, as the magnet does iron, but also repelled
them again, which was very amusing; for as soon as a small
quantity of ashes leaped upon it, and appeared as if endeavouring
to writhe themselves by force into the stone, they in
a little sprang from it again, as if about to make a new effort;
and on this account it was by the Dutch called the <i>ashes-drawer</i>.
The colour of it was an orange-red heightened by a
fire colour. When the turf coals were cold, it did not produce
these effects, and it required no care like the magnet.
I have considered whether it would not attract and repel
the ashes of other burning coals as well as those of turf; and
I have no doubt, that, if heated, it would attract other things
besides ashes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
This whole passage has been inserted word for word, without
variation or addition, and without telling the source from
which taken, in a book perhaps equally forgotten, called
Observationes curioso-physicæ, or Remarks and Observations
on the great Wonders of the World, by Felix Maurer, <span class="locked">physician<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a></span>.
This thick volume is entirely compiled from a number
of works, the names of which are not mentioned.</p>

<p>In the Catalogue of the collection of natural curiosities belonging
to Paul Hermann, which were sold at Leyden in June
1711, I find, among the precious stones, <i>Chrysolithus Turmale
Zeylon</i>. Though no description is added, it cannot be doubted
that our tourmaline is meant. From this however we learn
that the name together with the stone came to us from Ceylon,
as Watson has remarked. We learn further, that the stone
was at first considered as a chrysolite, and perhaps it may be
mentioned under this name in the old accounts of Ceylon.
Hermann, whose service to botany is well known, was in that
island from 1670 to 1677; and it might be presumed, from
his spirit of inquiry, that, had he known this stone, he would
somewhere or other in his works have taken notice of its properties:
but I find no mention of it either in his Cynosura
Materiæ Medicæ, or in Musæum Zeylonicum.</p>

<p>In the year 1719 the Academy of Sciences at Paris announced
in their memoirs for 1717, that in the latter year
M. Lemery had laid before them a stone found in a river in
the island of Ceylon, which attracted and repelled light <span class="locked">bodies<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a></span>.
It is there called a small magnet, though some difference between
the two stones was admitted; but the German naturalist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
before-mentioned, denies that the tourmaline is endowed
with magnetic virtue. It is however very remarkable, that
though it is said, in the Memoirs of the Academy, that it has
the power of attracting and repelling, no mention is made that
it acquires that property, only after it has been heated, which
is expressly remarked by the German. Those therefore who
wish to ascribe to the ancients a knowledge of the tourmaline
may say, If the editor of the Memoirs of the French Academy
could forget this circumstance, is it not highly probable that
Theophrastus might have forgot it in describing the lyncurium;
Pliny, in describing the carbuncle; and Serapion, in
describing his hyacinth?</p>

<p>After this period the tourmaline must have been very scarce
in Europe; for when Muschenbroek made his well-known
experiments with the loadstone, and spared no labour to carry
them to the utmost extent, he was not acquainted with the
nature of the tourmaline, which, according to the account
given of it by the Academy at Paris, he considered as a magnet,
as he himself says in the preface to his first dissertation,
published in 1724.</p>

<p>About the year 1740 however some German naturalists
made experiments with this stone, in order to discover the
real cause of its attractive property. These may be seen,
under the article <i>Trip</i>, in the well-known Dictionary of Natural
History which is often printed with Hübner’s preface; but
I do not know to whom the honour belongs of having first
investigated the properties of this stone. As the above dictionary
is common, I shall give here only a very short extract
from it:&mdash;“This stone was brought to Holland by some persons
who had travelled in India, from the island of Ceylon,
where it is found pretty frequently among the fine sand near
Columbo, and sold to the German Jews. These caused it to
be cut thinner, and the price of it soon rose to eight and ten
Dutch florins. It has been since much dearer; but at present
it is cheaper. It attracts not only ashes, but also metallic
calces: it however attracts more easily and with greater force
those which have been formed by means of sal-ammoniac, or
the spirit of that salt. It acquires its attractive power only
after it has been moderately heated; for when cold or heated
to a greater degree it produces no effect, which the author<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
ascribes to its being united with martial sulphur. The chrysolites
and other precious stones of the island do not possess
the same property.” As the author quotes the Laboratorium
Zeylonicum, I consulted it, but found no information in it respecting
the tourmaline. The first person who thought of
explaining the property of the tourmaline by electricity was
the great Linnæus, who in the preface to his Flora <span class="locked">Zeylanica<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a></span>,
where he enumerates the productions of the island, calls it the
electrical stone; but at that time, as he himself afterwards told
me, he had not seen it.</p>

<p>What Linnæus only conjectured, Æpinus proved at Berlin
in 1757 by accurate observation and experiments, when endeavouring
with Wilke to investigate the secret of negative
and positive electricity. The history of their discoveries I
shall here omit, as a better account of them than I could give
has been published in the Transactions of the Swedish Academy
by Wilke.</p>

<p>[The discovery by Huygens, in 1678, of the polarization of
light by double refraction, laid the foundation of a much more
important application of the tourmaline; for MM. Biot and
Seebeck, in their subsequent experiments, discovered that certain
yellowish tourmalines, that is, those which are yellowish
by refracted light, possessed the remarkable property of absorbing
or checking one of the rays of a beam of polarized
light, and transmitting the others. This discovery led to the
use of tourmalines in most experiments which were subsequently
made with polarized light. For this purpose, the
tourmaline, which generally crystallizes in the form of a long
prism, is cut lengthwise, that is, parallel to the axis of the
prism, into plates about the 30th of an inch thick.</p>

<p>The invention of Mr. Nichol of a method of destroying one
of the rays of a polarized beam in a crystal of calcareous spar,
has however in later times entirely replaced the use of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
tourmaline in optical science, the colour of the tourmaline
being a disadvantage which is entirely removed in the use of
Nichol’s <span class="locked">prism<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a></span>.]</p>

found in a river of the island of Ceylon. It is of the size of a denier, flat,
orbicular, about the tenth part of an inch in thickness, of a brown colour,
smooth and shining, without smell and without taste, which attracts and
afterwards repels small light bodies, such as ashes, filings of iron, and bits
of paper. It was shown by M. Lemery. It is not common, and that which
he had cost twenty-five livres (about twenty shillings sterling). When a
needle has been touched with a loadstone, the south pole of the loadstone
attracts the north pole of the needle, and repels its south pole: thus it
attracts or repels different parts of the same body, according as they are
presented to it, and it always attracts or repels the same. But the stone
of Ceylon attracts, and then repels in the like manner, the same small body
presented to it: in this it is very different from the loadstone. It would
seem that it has a vortex....”</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a name="Footnote_223" id="Footnote_223" href="#FNanchor_223" class="fnanchor">223</a>  [Light is called polarized, which, having been once reflected or refracted,
is incapable of being again reflected or refracted in certain positions of the
second medium. Ordinarily, light which has been reflected from a pane of
glass or any other substance, may be a second time reflected from another
surface, and will also freely pass through transparent bodies. But if a ray
of light be reflected from a pane of glass at an angle of 57°, it is rendered
totally incapable of reflexion from the surface of another pane in some
positions, whilst it will be completely reflected by it in others. If a plate
of tourmaline, cut in the manner described above, or a Nichol’s prism be
held between the eye and a candle, and turned slowly round in its own
plane, no change will take place in the image of the candle; but if the plate
or prism be fixed in a vertical position, on interposing another of the same
kind between the former and the eye, parallel to the first, and turning it
round slowly in its own plane, the image of the candle will be found to
vanish and re-appear alternately at each quarter turn of the plate, varying
through all degrees of brightness down to total or almost total evanescence,
and then increasing again by the same degrees as it had before
decreased. These changes depend upon the relative positions of the
plates; when the longitudinal sections of the two plates are parallel, the
brightness of the image is at its maximum; and when the axes of the sections
cross at right angles, the image of the candle vanishes. Thus the
light, in passing through the first plate of tourmaline, has acquired a property
totally different from the ordinary light of the candle; the latter
would penetrate the second plate equally well in all directions, whereas the
altered light will only pass through it in particular positions, and is altogether
incapable of penetrating it in others. The light is polarized by
passing through the first plate or prism. Thus, one of the properties of
polarized light is proved to be the incapability of passing through a plate
of tourmaline perpendicular to it in certain positions, and its ready transmission
in other positions at right angles to the former.]</p></div></div>

<h2 id="speaking">SPEAKING-TRUMPET.</h2>

<p>Instruments by which the voice could be so strengthened
as to be heard at a much greater distance than would otherwise
have been possible, were known in the earliest ages; for
of all musical instruments, wind instruments were first invented,
and their use in war to give the signal of battle, we find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
mentioned in <span class="locked">Job<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a></span>. It had been remarked, even in Pliny’s
time, that the least touch of a beam of wood could be heard
when the ear was applied to the other <span class="locked">end<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a></span>. It was known
likewise that the larger trumpets emitted a louder and stronger
sound. The Grecians had a wind instrument with the bellowing
noise of which the people who were placed to guard
the vineyards frightened away the wild <span class="locked">animals<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a></span>. All these
wind instruments however were little in comparison with the
monstrous trumpets of the ancient Chinese, a kind of speaking-trumpets,
or instruments by which words could not only
be heard at the greatest distance possible, but could be also
<span class="locked">understood<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a></span>. This invention belongs to the 17th century,
though some think that traces of it are to be found among
the ancient Grecians.</p>

<p>Kircher, as far as I have been able to learn, was the first
person who made known, from a very ancient manuscript of
Aristotle, De Secretis ad Alexandrum Magnum, preserved in
the Vatican, that Alexander had a prodigious large horn with
which he could assemble his army at the distance of a hundred
stadia, or eight Italian miles. It was, according to the manuscript,
five cubits in diameter; and Kircher, who gives a figure
of it, which he says he found in the manuscript, thinks that,
on account of its size, it must have been suspended from a
beam by a ring. This horn has by many been considered as
the oldest <span class="locked">speaking-trumpet<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a></span>, but in my opinion without reason.
Aristotelis Secretum Secretorum ad Alexandrum Magnum
I have never had an opportunity to see. It appears to
have been printed only once, and is, like all the other works
ascribed to that philosopher, extremely scarce; for they have
all had the fate of being little regarded after it became the
unanimous opinion of the learned that they were forged.
These works, however, are old; some of them indeed very old:
and, if some one would take the trouble to fix their antiquity,
they might be used with advantage on many occasions. Morhof<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
had in his possession the edition of that book published by
Alexander Achillinus, a physician at Bologna, in 1516, which
is a Latin translation from the <span class="locked">Arabic<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a></span>. If we compare what
is said there and by Kircher, we may make the following <span class="locked">conclusion:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>In the first place, it is certain that the book itself, as well
as the whole account, is not the production of Aristotle, for
in all the writers who relate the actions of Alexander we do
not find the least mention of such a horn. Secondly, it is not
expressly said in that work that Alexander spoke through this
horn, but only that he assembled his soldiers by it, which in
past times was done by the sound of a trumpet, and at present
is done both by trumpets and drums. It appears also that the
author of the book, perhaps an Arabian, intended to give the
reader an idea of a horn that had an uncommonly strong and
loud sound. Thirdly, Kircher’s account and figure of the
horn do not agree with that which Morhof found in the edition
of <span class="locked">Achillinus<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a></span>. Lastly, none of these descriptions are
such that an instrument to serve as a speaking-trumpet could
be constructed from them.</p>

<p>Wolf and other mathematicians are of opinion that the most
advantageous form of a speaking-trumpet would be found with
more certainty by experience than by theory. It may then
be asked, whether any one ever caused such an instrument to
be made from these descriptions. Kircher, who attempted
things much more improbable, says he never tried it. Duhamel
however relates that a Frenchman tried it, and discovered
the real <span class="locked">instrument<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a></span>; but this information is of little weight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
as it is much to be doubted that this Frenchman caused it to
be made sufficiently exact according to the ancient description.
I am as little acquainted with Bettini as Morhof; but I suspect
that Duhamel meant Mar. Bettini, who, without making
the smallest mention of Alexander’s horn, proposes only a
tube, the one end of which should be applied to the mouth of
a person who speaks, and the other to the ear of one who
is dull of <span class="locked">hearing<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a></span>. This was rather an ear-trumpet than a
speaking-trumpet, and it is certain that the former was invented
before the latter.</p>

<p>What we read in Porta, and what many think alludes to a
speaking-trumpet, alludes evidently to an ear-trumpet only.
That author infers, very justly, from the form of the ear, and
particularly from that of the ears of those animals which are
quick of hearing, that to hear at a distance one must apply to
the ear a kind of wide funnel, as people to strengthen the sight
use <span class="locked">spectacles<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a></span>. He asserts also, with equal truth, that one,
through a long tube, can convey a whisper to the ear of
another person at a very great <span class="locked">distance<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a></span>; an experiment
which he himself made at the distance of two hundred paces.
Schwenter, who wrote before the speaking-trumpet was
known, proposes, from the hint of Porta, an ear-trumpet, one
end of which should be applied to the <span class="locked">ear<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a></span>.</p>

<p>Sir Samuel Morland, an Englishman, and the jesuit Kircher,
have in later times contended respecting the invention
of the speaking-trumpet. The former, in 1671, published a
particular description of one, after he had made many experiments
upon it the year preceding. This instrument, shaped
like a wide-mouthed trumpet, he caused first to be constructed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
of glass, and afterwards of copper, with various alterations,
and performed several experiments with it in presence of the
king (Charles II.), prince Rupert, and other persons, who
were astonished at its <span class="locked">effects<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a></span>.</p>

<p>As an account of this discovery was soon spread all over
Europe, Kircher asserted that he had constructed speaking-trumpets
before Sir Samuel Morland, and supported his assertion
by referring to his former writings, and by the testimony
of other authors. I shall first take notice of the former. His
Ars Magna Lucis et Umbræ was first printed in 1643. I at
least conclude so, because, in the preface to his Phonurgia,
printed in 1673, he says that work had been published thirty
years before. The second edition is of 1671, in which I find
only the already-quoted passage respecting Alexander’s horn,
and the figure of a tube, which, like that proposed by Bettini,
should be applied to the ear of a person who hears, and to
the mouth of the speaker. The Musurgia, printed in 1650,
contains better grounds for supporting the assertion of Kircher.
In the second part he describes how a funnel can be
placed in a building in such a manner, that a person in an
apartment where the narrow end is introduced can hear what
is spoken without the building, or in another apartment, where
the wide end may be. To this description a figure is added,
and the author acknowledges he was led to that idea by the
construction of a well-known building of <span class="locked">Dionysius<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a></span>. He does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
not however say expressly that he had ever tried the experiment;
but in the last page of the preface to the Phonurgia,
he pretends that so early as the year 1649 he had caused such
a machine to be fixed up in the Jesuits’ college. But, supposing
this to be true, it can only be said that he then approached
very near to the invention of the speaking-trumpet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
by an instrument, which, in reality, however, was calculated
to strengthen the hearing, and not the voice; and therefore
only the half is true of what he advanced in his preface in
1673, that twenty years before he had described in his Musurgia
the trumpet invented in England.</p>

<p>In the Phonurgia, however, written after Morland’s publication
was everywhere known, Kircher certainly treats of the
speaking-trumpet, and says that, from the similarity of the
progress of sound to that of the rays of light, he was led to
the idea of conveying the former, in the same manner as the
latter, to a great distance, by means of an instrument. For
this purpose, about twenty-four years before, he had caused
to be constructed, in the Jesuits’ college at Rome, an ear-trumpet,
through which the porter could communicate anything
he had to say to him when he was in his apartment in
the upper story. This apparatus attracted the notice of many
strangers, who were astonished at its effect. He here represents
it as a proper speaking-trumpet, and adds, that it excited
much surprise, on account of the uncommon strength
which it gave to the voice. For this reason he was very desirous
of trying to what distance words could be distinctly
conveyed by such a tube; and an opportunity occurred of
doing this the same year that he wrote his Phonurgia. From
a convent, situated on the top of a mountain, he assembled
twelve hundred persons to divine service, at the distance of
from two to five Italian miles, and read the Litany through it.
Soon after, the emperor caused a tube to be made according
to Kircher’s description, by which, without elevating the
voice, he could be understood from Ebersdorf to Neugebeu.
But though Kircher came so near to the invention of the
speaking-trumpet, it does not appear certain by his works that
he attempted or constructed it before Sir Samuel Morland.
I shall now examine the evidences he adduces in his favour.</p>

<p>The most important of these is Schott, because he published
his Magia <span class="locked">Naturalis<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">238</a></span> in 1657, before the invention of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
Sir Samuel Morland. All that is to be found in this work,
however, relates alone to the ear-trumpet, a figure of which
is added from the Musurgia; but we learn, with certainty,
that Kircher then had the before-mentioned funnel or tube in
his apartment. It is also not improbable that he had tried to
answer the porter from his apartment, and that he had thereby
remarked that the voice was strengthened; for it is not proved
by Schott that he at that time was acquainted with and had
in his possession a portable speaking-trumpet.</p>

<p>Another author by whom Kircher endeavours to support
his claim is Harsdorfer; who, however, speaks only of tubes
to be closely applied to the mouth and to the ear, and who
refers to the Musurgia, without mentioning the real speaking-trumpet,
though the second part of his Mathematical Recreations
was first printed in 1677, and the third in 1692.
Besides these testimonies, Kircher quotes also Eschinard concerning
<span class="locked">sound<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a></span>. With that work I am not acquainted; but
as the information it contains is taken from the Musurgia, it
is of as little importance as that of <span class="locked">Derham<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a></span>, who refuses the
invention to his countryman, and gives it to Kircher. When
I unite all the evidence in favour of Kircher, it appears to be
certain that he made known and employed the ear-trumpet earlier
than the portable speaking-trumpet; that he, however,
approached very near to the invention of the latter, but did
not cause one to be constructed before Sir Samuel Morland,
to whom the honour belongs of having first brought it to that
state as to be of real use. Such, at least, is the manner in
which this dispute is decided by the Jesuit De <span class="locked">Lanis<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a></span>.</p>

<p>When Morland’s invention was made known in France, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
was pretended that Salar, an Augustine monk, had seven or
eight years before caused such tubes or trumpets to be made,
in order to strengthen the voice of a weak bass-singer; but
he himself acknowledges that he never had an idea of speaking
with them at a <span class="locked">distance<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a></span>.</p>

<p>This instrument was soon made for sale at Nuremberg in
Germany, particularly by that well-known artist Grundler,
mentioned by Becher, who imagined that two persons, by
means of a speaking-trumpet and an ear-trumpet, could converse
together at a great distance, without any one in the
neighbourhood, or in the intermediate space, hearing what
they said.</p>

<p>Of those who employed their ingenuity in improving this
instrument I shall mention the following. Cassegrain, known
on account of his optical instruments, published some hints for
that purpose in <span class="locked">1672<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">243</a></span>; as did <span class="locked">Sturm<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a></span>, <span class="locked">Conyers<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a></span>, Hase and
others afterwards. The last who investigated the theory of
the speaking-trumpet was <span class="locked">Lambert<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a></span>; according to whose
ideas the figure of a shortened cone, if not the best, is at least
as good as any other that might be employed.</p>

<p>[It would appear, however, from the experiments of Hassenfratz
(Journ. de Phys., t. xxvi.) that neither the shape of the
instrument nor the material of which it is composed is of much
consequence. He ascertained the power of the trumpet by
fixing a small watch in the mouth-piece, and observing the
distance at which the beats ceased to be audible, and thus
found that the effects were precisely the same with a trumpet
of tinned iron, whether used in its naked form, or tightly
bound round with linen to prevent vibration, or when lined
with woollen cloth whereby reflexion was entirely prevented;
he also found that the range of a cylindrical trumpet was as
great as that of a conical one.</p>

<p>Leslie supposes the effect of the trumpet to be owing to the
more condensed and vigorous impulsion given to the air from
its lateral flow being checked. He observes, “that the tube,
by its length and narrowness, detains the efflux of air, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
has the same effect as if it diminished the volubility of that
fluid, or increased its density. The organs of articulation
strike with concentrated force, and the pulses, so vigorously
thus excited, are, from the reflected form of the aperture,
finally enabled to escape and to spread themselves along the

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a name="Footnote_237" id="Footnote_237" href="#FNanchor_237" class="fnanchor">237</a>  Among the antiquities of Syracuse in Sicily, one beholds with wonder
chambers and galleries which are hewn out in the solid rock, and particularly
a grotto, from which arises a winding passage, that becomes upwards
still narrower. Ancient tradition says that this was a prison, which
the celebrated tyrant Dionysius caused to be built for state prisoners, that
in an apartment of his palace, which stood over the narrow end of the
passage, he might hear everything the prisoners said, or what plots they
formed against him. This grotto therefore is called <i>Orechio di Dionysio</i>,
or <i>la grotta della favella</i>; <i>auris Dionysii</i>, the ear of Dionysius. Many
travellers and others formerly imagined that this passage was an ingenious
imitation of that part of the human ear called the helix, which was first
remarked by Alcmaon the Pythagorean. This is the account given by
Kircher, who was there in the year 1638. See his Phonurgia (published
1673), p. 82, where there is a figure of it. In later times, however, this
grotto has been examined with more skill and acuteness by people less
subject to prejudice, and since that period the supposed wonder has been
lessened. The rock consists of limestone, at least I conclude so from what
is said by Brydone, who found it everywhere full of cracks and fissures.
The stones of which Syracuse was built were hewn from the rock; and
hence have been formed these chambers or openings, like those found in
the neighbourhood of other ancient and modern cities, such as Rome,
Naples, and Maestricht. Many of these, in the course of time, have been
employed as prisons, or used as burying-vaults. The above-mentioned
passage, which has excited so much wonder, is not properly spiral, and is
of such a figure that it may have been produced either by accident or
through the whim of the workmen employed to hew out the stones. The
double echo which Kircher assures us he heard in the grotto was not remarked
by Schott, who was there in 1646, as he expressly says, in opposition
to his brother jesuit, in his Magia Naturalis. In the accounts still
remaining of Dionysius we find mention of an astonishing prison, which
is well described by Cicero in his fifth oration against Verres: “You have
all heard of,” says he, “and most of you know the prison (lautumias) of
Syracuse. It is an immense and magnificent work, executed by kings and
tyrants; the whole is sunk to a wonderful depth in the rock, and has been
entirely cut out by the labour of many hands. No place so secured against
an escape; no place so enclosed on all sides; no place so safe for confining
prisoners can be either planned out or constructed.” But it cannot
be proved, and according to D’Orville’s opinion it is improbable, that
this grotto was the work of that tyrant, who, as Plutarch tells us in his
Life of Dion, employed very different means to learn the intention of dangerous
persons. “The common people attacked the tyrant’s friends, and
seized those whom they called his emissaries (<span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">προσαγώγιδας</span>), worthless
men, detested by the gods. These went about the city, mixed with the
citizens, and, prying into everything, gave an account to the tyrant of
what they thought and what expressions they made use of.” It was
merely for its strength, and the labour employed in building it, and not
on account of its ingenious construction, that the ancients admired the
prison of the tyrant. At present the upper end of the winding passage is
closed up; and it is so narrow, that some years ago the captain of an
English vessel found great difficulty to clamber up it. It cannot, however,
be denied that this grotto may have been used for the service ascribed
to it; and I can readily believe that it may have led Kircher to the invention
of the ear-trumpet. See the Travels of P. de la Valle, Ray, and Brydone;

Dionysius; nor is it a vain and empty speculation, for the machine produces
an infallible effect. Kircher caused to be made at Rome, of tin
plate, a very large and straight tube, like a funnel, and placed it in an
apartment next to his chamber, in such a manner that the large end projected
into the garden of the college, and the less entered his chamber.

he might not be obliged always to go up stairs, or to bawl out, he went to

<h2 id="ananas">ANANAS.&mdash;PINE-APPLE.</h2>

<p>To discover the excellence of the ananas required no great
skill; it recommended itself so much by its taste, smell, and
colour, as to attract the notice of the first Europeans who
visited Brazil; and we find it praised in the earliest writers on
America, who give an account of it, as well as of tobacco,
maize, and other productions of the new world.</p>

<p>Gonçalo Hernandez de Oviedo is, as far as I know, the first
person who described and delineated the ananas. This author
was born at Madrid in 1478, went to America in 1513, and in
1535 was governor of St. Domingo. In the last-mentioned
year his General History of America was printed at Seville.
At that time three kinds were known, which in America were
called <i>yayama</i>, <i>boniama</i>, and <i>yayagua</i>, but by the Spaniards
<i>pinas</i>. Attempts had then been made to send the fruit to
Spain by pulling it before it was ripe; but it had always become
spoilt in the course of the voyage. Oviedo had tried
also to send slips or young shoots to Europe, but these also
died by the way. He however entertained hopes that means
would be found to rear the ananas in Spain, in which maize
or Turkish corn had been brought to maturity, provided it
could be transported with sufficient <span class="locked">expedition<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
Geronimo Benzono, a Milanese, who resided in Mexico
from 1541 to 1555, caused, on his return, his History of the
New World to be printed, for the first time, at Venice in
1568. In this work he highly extols the pinas, and says he
believes that no fruit on the earth can be more pleasant; sick
persons, who loathed all other food, might relish it.</p>

<p>After him, Andrew Thevet, a French monk, who was in
Brazil from 1555 to 1556, described and delineated this plant
under the name of <i>nanas</i>. The art of preserving the fruit with
sugar was at that time <span class="locked">known<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a></span>.</p>

<p>John de Lery, who went to Brazil in 1557 as chaplain to a
Huguenot colony, in the account of his voyage first used the
word <i>ananas</i>, which probably took its rise from the <i>nanas</i> of
<span class="locked">Thevet<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a></span>.</p>

<p>In the middle of the sixteenth century Franc. Hernandes,
a naturalist, undertook an expensive, and almost useless
voyage to Mexico. It cost Philip II. king of Spain 60,000
ducats, and the observations he collected, for which, at the
time Acosta was in America, 1200 figures were ready, were
never completely printed; and in what are printed one can
scarcely distinguish those of the original author from the additions
of strangers. He has, however, given a somewhat better
figure of the ananas, which he calls <i>matzatli</i> or <i>pinea Indica</i><a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">251</a>.</p>

<p>Christopher Acosto, in his Treatise of the drugs and medicines
of the East Indies, printed in 1578, calls this plant the
ananas. He says it was brought from Santa Cruz to the
West Indies, and that it was afterwards transplanted to the
East Indies and China, where it was at that time common.
The latter part of this account is confirmed by J. Hugo de
Linschotten, who was in the East Indies from 1594 to <span class="locked">1595<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">252</a></span>.</p>

<p>Attempts were very early made, as Oviedo assures us, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
transplant the ananas into Europe; and as in the beginning
of the seventeenth century it was reckoned among the marks
of royal magnificence to have orange-trees in expensive hot-houses,
it was hoped that this fruit could be brought to maturity
also in the artificial climate of these buildings. These
attempts, however, were everywhere unsuccessful; no fruit
was produced, or it did not ripen, because, perhaps, this
favourite exotic was treated with too much care. It is not
certainly known who in Europe first had the pleasure of
seeing ananas ripen in his garden; but it appears that several
enjoyed that satisfaction at the same time in the beginning of
the last century.</p>

<p>The German gardens in which the ananas was first brought
to maturity appear to have been the following. First, that of
Baron de Munchausen, at Schwobber, not far from Hameln,
which on account of the botanical knowledge of its proprietor,
and the abundance of plants it contains, is well-known to all
those who are fond of botany. In the beginning of the last
century it belonged to Otto de Munchausen, who, perhaps,
was the first person who erected large buildings for the express
purpose of raising that fruit, and who had the noble satisfaction
of making known their advantageous construction. With
this view he sent a description and plan of his ananas-houses
to J. Christopher Volkamer, a merchant of Nuremberg, who
inserted them in his continuation of the Nuremberg Hesperides,
printed there in 1714, and by these means rendered the
attainment of this fruit common. This Baron de Munchausen
is the same who has been celebrated by Leibnitz: “All the
travellers in the world,” says that great man, “could not have
given us, by their relations, what we are indebted for to a
gentleman of this country, who cultivates with success the
ananas, three leagues from Hanover, almost on the banks of
the Weser, and who has found out the method of multiplying
them, so that we may, perhaps, have them one day as plentiful,
of our own growth, as the Portuguese oranges, though
there will, in all appearance, be some deficiency in the <span class="locked">taste<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a></span>.”
As the Baron Munchausen’s garden at Schwobber was in the
absence of the proprietor, as Volkamer says, under the care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
of J. F. Berner, canon of the cathedral of St. Boniface, he
probably may have had some share in rendering this service
to horticulture.</p>

<p>This fruit was produced also in the garden of Dr. Volkamer
at Nuremberg, and in that of Dr. F. Kaltschmid
at Breslau, almost about the same time. The latter was so
fortunate as to bring it to maturity so early as 1702, and he
sent some of it then for the first time to the imperial court.
At Frankfort on the Maine it was first produced in <span class="locked">1702<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a></span>;
and at Cassel in 1715, by the skill of Wurstorfs, the head
gardener.</p>

<p>Holland procured the first ripe ananas from the garden of
De la Court, whom Miller calls Le Cour, in the neighbourhood
of Leyden. As a great many plants were sold out of
this garden to foreigners, and as the English had theirs first
from it, many are of opinion that Europe is indebted for the
first possession of this fruit to De la Court, and his gardener
William de <span class="locked">Vinck<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a></span>.</p>

<p>I shall here take occasion to mention a circumstance which
belongs also to the history of gardening. Before the cultivation
of the ananas was introduced, the Dutch had begun to
employ tanner’s bark for making forcing-beds. From them
the English learned this improvement, and the first forcing-beds
in England were made at Blackheath in Kent, in 1688,
and employed for rearing orange-trees; but about the year
1719, much later than in Holland, ananas became more common,
and forcing-beds were in much greater <span class="locked">use<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">256</a></span>.</p>

<p>This plant, the history of which I have given, received from
<span class="locked">Plumier<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a></span>, who first distinguished its characters, the name of
<i>Bromelia</i><a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a>, after the Swedish naturalist, whose remembrance
deserves to be here revived. Olof Bromelius was born in 1639,
at Oerebro, where his father carried on trade. He studied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
physic at Upsal, disputed there in 1667 de Pleuritide, and in
1668 taught botany at Stockholm. In 1672 he was physician
to the embassy to England, and afterwards to that to Holland,
where, in 1673, he received the degree of doctor at Leyden,
and wrote a dissertation De Lumbricis. On his return to his
native country, in 1674, he became a member of the college
of physicians at Stockholm; but in 1691 he was city physician
to Gottenburg, and provincial physician in Elsburg and Bahuslan,
in which situation he died in the year 1705. His botanical
writings are Lupologia, and Chloris <span class="locked">Gothica<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">259</a></span>. His son,
Magnus von Bromel, is the author of Lithographia Suecana.</p>

<p>[Within the few last years, large numbers of pine-apples
have been imported into this country from the Bahamas, where
they are grown as turnips are grown in our fields. They are
sold comparatively speaking at an extremely moderate price,
and those that have become somewhat spoilt by the long carriage
are hawked about the streets of London at a halfpenny
or penny per slice. They are however vastly inferior in flavour
to the pines cultivated in our hot-houses, but it is to be expected,
from the considerable demand, that greater care will be
bestowed on their cultivation, and the markets of London be
regularly supplied with a much improved kind.]</p>

new milk, and of making the writing legible by coal-dust or
soot. Ausonius proposes the same means to <span class="locked">Paulinus<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">261</a></span>; but his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
commentators seem not to have fully understood his meaning;
for <i>favilla</i> is not to be explained by <i>favilla non modice calida</i>,
as Vinetus has explained it, but by <i>fuligo</i>. That word is often
employed by the poets in the same sense. As a proof of it,
Columella, speaking of the method, not altogether ineffectual,
and even still used, of preserving plants from insects by soot,
calls it <i>nigra favilla</i>; and afterwards, when mentioning the
same method, free from poetical fetters, he says <i>fuliginem quæ
supra focos tectis inhæret</i><a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">262</a>. It may be easily perceived, that
instead of milk any other colourless and glutinous juice might
be employed, as it would equally hold fast the black powder
strewed over it. Pliny, therefore, recommends the milky sap
of certain plants for the like <span class="locked">purpose<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a></span>.</p>

<p>There are several metallic solutions perfectly colourless, or,
at least, without any strong tint, which being used for writing,
the letters will not appear until the paper be washed over
with another colourless solution, or exposed to the vapour of
it; but among all these there is none which excites more astonishment,
than that which consists of a solution of lead in acetic
acid, and which by sulphuretted hydrogen gas becomes black,
even at a considerable distance. This ink, which may be employed
by conjurers, proves the subtlety of this gas, and the
porosity of bodies; as the change or colouring takes place, even
when the writing is placed on the other side of a thin wall.</p>

<p>This effect presented itself perhaps accidentally to some
chemist; but the discovery is not of great antiquity. Wecker,
who compiled his book De Secretis from Porta, Cardan, and
several old writers, and printed it for the first time in 1582,
and gave a third edition in 1592, must have been unacquainted
with it; else he certainly would not have omitted it in the
fourteenth book, where he mentions all the methods of secret
writing. Neither would it have been unnoticed by Caneparius,
whose book De Atramentis was printed at Venice, for the first
time, in 1619.</p>

<p>The first person who, as far as I have been able to learn,
gave a receipt for preparing this ink, was Peter Borel, in
Historiarum et Observationum Medico-physic. Centuriæ quatuor.
In this work, which was printed for the first time in 1653,
and a second time in 1657, at Paris, and of which there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
several editions afterwards, the author calls it a magnetic water,
which acts at a <span class="locked">distance<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">264</a></span>. After the occult qualities of the
schoolmen were exploded, it was customary to ascribe phænomena,
the causes of which were unknown, and particularly
those the causes of which seemed to operate without any visible
agency, to magnetic effluvia; as the tourmaline was at first
considered to be a kind of magnet. Others concealed their
ignorance under what they called sympathy, and in latter
times attraction and electricity have been employed for the
like purpose. Borel, who made it his business to collect new
observations that were kept secret, learned the method of preparing
this magnetic water from an ingenious apothecary of
Montpelier, and in return taught him some other secrets. Otto
Tachen, a German <span class="locked">chemist<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a></span>, afterwards thought of the same
experiment, which he explains much better, without the assistance
of magnetism or sympathy. The receipt for making
these liquids, under the name of sympathetic ink, I find first
given by Le <span class="locked">Mort<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">266</a></span>, and that name has been still <span class="locked">retained<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">267</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
Another remarkable kind of sympathetic ink is that prepared
from cobalt, the writing of which disappears in the cold,
but appears again of a beautiful green colour, as often as one
chooses, after being exposed to a moderate degree of heat.</p>

<p>The invention of this ink is generally ascribed to a Frenchman
named Hellot. He was, indeed, the first person who,
after trying experiments with it, made it publicly known, but
he was not the inventor; and he himself acknowledges that a
German artist of Stolberg first showed him a reddish salt,
which, when exposed to heat, became blue, and which he assured
him was made out of Schneeberg cobalt, with aqua
<span class="locked">regia<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">268</a></span>. This account induced Hellot to prepare salts and ink
from various minerals impregnated with cobalt; but A. Gesner
proved, long after, that this ink is produced by cobalt only,
and not by <span class="locked">marcasite<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">269</a></span>.</p>

<p>When Hellot’s experiments were made known in Germany,
it was affirmed that Professor H. F. Teichmeyer, at Jena, had
prepared the same ink six years before, and shown it to his
scholars, in the course of his lectures, under the name of sympathetic
<span class="locked">ink<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">270</a></span>. It appears, however, that it was invented, even
before Teichmeyer, in the beginning of the last century by a
German lady. This is confirmed by Pot, who says that the
authoress of a book printed in 1705, which he quotes under
the unintelligible title of D. J. W. in clave, had given a proper
receipt for preparing the above-mentioned red salt, and the
ink produced by <span class="locked">it<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a></span>. If it be true that Theophrastus Paracelsus,
by means of this invention, could represent a garden
in winter, it must be undoubtedly <span class="locked">older<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">272</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
[In consequence of the progress of modern chemistry and
the discovery of a vast number of new chemical compounds,
sympathetic inks may be made in an almost endless number
and variety. The principal may be classed in the following
manner:&mdash;1, <i>such as when dried upon paper being invisible,
on moistening with another liquid become again evident</i>: of
this kind there are a vast number; among which we may
mention a solution of a soluble salt of lead, or bismuth, for
writing, and a solution of sulphuretted hydrogen for washing
over; the writing then appears black; or green vitriol for
writing and prussiate of potash for washing over, when the
writing becomes <span class="locked">blue<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">273</a></span>; 2, <i>such as are rendered evident by
being sifted over with some powder</i>, as the milk with soot described
above; 3, <i>those which become visible by heat</i>, such as
characters in dilute sulphuric acid, lemon-juice, solutions of
the nitrate and chloride of cobalt, and of chloride of copper;
the two former become black or brown, the latter are rendered
green, the colouring disappearing subsequently when allowed
to cool in a moist place. Amusing pictures are sometimes
made with these sympathetic inks, particularly those composed
of cobalt; for if a landscape be drawn to represent winter, the
vegetation being covered with a solution of cobalt, on holding
the paper to the fire, all those portions covered with the solution
appear of a bright green, and thus completely change the
character of the scene.]</p>

<p class="fn3"><a name="Footnote_264" id="Footnote_264" href="#FNanchor_264" class="fnanchor">264</a>  The sixth observation of the second century is as follows: <i>Magnetic
waters which act at a distance</i>. An astonishing effect, indeed, is produced
by the contest of the following waters, which are thus made. Let quick-lime
be quenched in common water, and while quenching, let some orpiment
be added to it (this however ought to be done by placing warm ashes
under it for a whole day), and let the liquor be filtered, and preserved in a
glass bottle well corked. Then boil litharge of gold well pounded, for
half an hour with vinegar in a brass vessel, and filter the whole through
paper, and preserve it also in a bottle closely corked. If you write any
thing with this last water with a clean pen, the writing will be invisible
when dry; but if it be washed over with the first water it will become
instantly black. In this, however, there is nothing astonishing; but this
is wonderful, that though sheets of paper without number, and even a
board be placed between the invisible writing and the second liquid, it will
have the same effect, and turn the writing black, penetrating the wood and
paper without leaving any traces of its action, which is certainly surprising;
but a fetid smell, occasioned by the mutual action of the liquids, deters
many from making the experiment. I am, however, of opinion, that I
could improve this secret by a more refined chemical preparation, so that
it should perform its effect through a wall. This secret I received, in exchange
for others, from J. Brosson, a learned and ingenious apothecary of

<h2 id="diving">DIVING-BELL.</h2>

<p>The first divers learned their art by early and adventurous
experience, in trying to continue under water as long as possible
without breathing; and, indeed, it must be allowed that
some of them carried it to very great perfection. This art,
however, excites little surprise; for, like running, throwing,
and other bodily dexterities, it requires only practice; but it
is certain that those nations called by us uncultivated and savage
excel in it the <span class="locked">Europeans<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">274</a></span>, who, through refinement and
luxury, have become more delicate, and less fit for such laborious
exercises.</p>

<p>In remote ages, divers were kept in ships to assist in raising
<span class="locked">anchors<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">275</a></span>, and goods thrown overboard in times of <span class="locked">danger<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">276</a></span>; and,
by the laws of the Rhodians, they were allowed a share of the
wreck, proportioned to the depth to which they had gone in
search of <span class="locked">it<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">277</a></span>. In war, they were often employed to destroy
the works and ships of the enemy. When Alexander was
besieging Tyre, divers swam off from the city, under water,
to a great distance, and with long hooks tore to pieces the
mole with which the besiegers were endeavouring to block
up the <span class="locked">harbour<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">278</a></span>. The pearls of the Greek and Roman ladies
were fished up by divers at the great hazard of their lives;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
and by the like means are procured at present those which
are purchased as ornaments by our fair.</p>

<p>I do not know whether observations have ever been collected
respecting the time that divers can continue under
water. Anatomists once believed that persons in whom the
oval opening of the heart (<i>foramen ovale</i>) was not closed up,
could live longer than others without breathing, and could
therefore be expert divers. <span class="locked">Haller<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">279</a></span>, however, and others,
have controverted this opinion; as people who had that opening
have been soon suffocated, and as animals which have it not
can live a long time under water: besides, when that opening
is perceptible in grown persons, it is so small as not to be sufficient
for that purpose, especially as the <i>ductus arteriosus</i> is
scarcely ever found open.</p>

<p>The divers of Astracan, employed in the fishery there, can
remain only seven minutes under <span class="locked">water<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">280</a></span>. The divers in Holland
seem to have been more expert. An observer, during
the time they were under water, was obliged to breathe at
least ten <span class="locked">times<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">281</a></span>. Those who collect pearl-shells in the East
Indies can remain under water a quarter of an hour, though
some are of opinion that it is possible to continue longer;
and Mersenne mentions a diver, named John Barrinus, who
could dive under water for six <span class="locked">hours<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">282</a></span>. How far this may be
true I shall leave others to judge.</p>

<p>[The various statements regarding the length of time during
which divers can remain under water, unaided by apparatus
for renewing the supply of atmospheric air, are not borne out
by the experience of those who have carefully observed and
noted these phænomena. The average time which human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
beings can remain in the water under these conditions, is one
and a half or two <span class="locked">minutes<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">283</a></span>; extraordinary cases are attested
where five and even six minutes have elapsed, but these are
exceedingly rare instances and far beyond the average; no instance
of a longer time than this is recorded on credible
authority. Some interesting remarks on this point were made
not long since by a member of the Asiatic Society to Dr. Faraday.
The lungs in their natural state are charged with a
large quantity of impure air; this being a portion of the carbonic
acid gas which is formed during respiration, but which,
after each expiration, remains lodged in the involved passages
of the pulmonary tubes. By breathing hard for a short time,
as a person does after violent exercise, this impure air is expelled,
and its place is supplied by pure atmospheric air, by
which a person will be enabled to hold his breath much longer
than without such precaution. Dr. Faraday states, that although
he could only hold his breath, after breathing in the ordinary
way, for about three-fourths of a minute, and that with great
difficulty, he felt no inconvenience, after making eight or ten
forced respirations to clear the lungs, until the mouth and
nostrils had been closed more than a minute and a half; and
that he continued to hold breath to the end of the second minute.
A knowledge of this fact may enable a diver to remain
under water at least twice as long as he otherwise could do.
It is suggested that possibly the exertion of swimming may
have the effect of occasioning the lungs to be cleared, so that
persons accustomed to diving may unconsciously avail themselves
of this preparatory measure.]</p>

<p>It is certain, however, that men began very early to contrive
means for supplying divers with air under the water, and
of thereby enabling them to remain under it much longer.
For this purpose the diving-bell, <i>campana urinatoria</i>, was
invented. Those who had no idea of this machine, might
have easily been led to it by the following experiment. If a
drinking-glass inverted be immersed in water, in such a manner
that the surface of the water may rise equally around the
edge of the glass, it will be found that the glass does not become
filled with water, even when pressed down to the greatest
depth; for where there is air no other body can enter, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
by the above precaution the air cannot be expelled by the
water. In like manner, if a bell of metal be constructed under
which the diver can stand on a stool suspended from it so that
the edge of the bell may reach to about his knee, the upper
part of his body will be secured from water, and he can, even
at the bottom of the sea, breathe the air enclosed in the bell.</p>

<p>The invention of this bell is generally assigned to the sixteenth
century, and I am of opinion that it was little known
before that period. We read, however, that even in the time
of Aristotle divers used a kind of kettle to enable them to continue
longer under water; but the manner in which it was
employed is not clearly described.</p>

<p>The oldest information we have respecting the use of the
diving-bell in Europe is that of John Taisnier, quoted by
<span class="locked">Schott<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">284</a></span>. The former, who was born at Hainault in 1509, had
a place at court under Charles V., whom he attended on his
voyage to Africa. He relates in what manner he saw at Toledo,
in the presence of the emperor and several thousand
spectators, two Greeks let themselves down under water, in a
large inverted kettle, with a burning light, and rise up again
without being wet. It appears that this art was then new to
the emperor and the Spaniards, and that the Greeks were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
induced to make the experiment in order to prove the possibility
of it. After this period the use of the diving-bell seems
to have become still better known. It is described more than
once in the works of Lord Bacon, who explains its effects, and
remarks that it was invented to facilitate labour under the
<span class="locked">water<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">285</a></span>.</p>

<p>In the latter part of the seventeenth century the diving-bell
was sometimes employed in great undertakings. When the
English, in the year 1588, dispersed the Spanish fleet called
the Invincible Armada, part of the ships went to the bottom
near the Isle of Mull, on the western coast of Scotland; and
some of these, according to the account of the Spanish prisoners,
contained great riches. This information excited, from
time to time, the avarice of speculators, and gave rise to several
attempts to procure part of the lost treasure. In the year
1665, a person was so fortunate as to bring up some cannon,
which, however, were not sufficient to defray the expenses.
Of these attempts, and the kind of diving-bell used, an account
has been given by a Scotsman named <span class="locked">Sinclair<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">286</a></span>; but
<span class="locked">Paschius<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">287</a></span>, <span class="locked">Leupold<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">288</a></span> and others falsely ascribe the invention
of this machine to that learned man. He himself does not
lay claim to this honour; but says only, that he conversed
with the artist and measured the machine.</p>

<p>Some years after attempts of the like kind were renewed.
William Phipps, the son of a blacksmith, born in America in
1650, and who had been brought up as a ship-carpenter at
Boston, formed a project for searching and unloading a rich
Spanish ship sunk on the coast of Hispaniola, and represented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
his plan in such a plausible manner, that king Charles II. gave
him a ship, and furnished him with every thing necessary for
the undertaking. He set sail in the year 1683; but, being
unsuccessful, returned again in great poverty, though with a
firm conviction of the possibility of his scheme. He endeavoured,
therefore, to procure another vessel from James II.,
who was then on the throne; but as he failed in this, he tried
to find the means of executing his design by the support of
private persons, and, according to the prevailing practice,
opened for that purpose a subscription. At first he was
laughed at; but at length the duke of Albemarle, son of
the celebrated General Monk, took part in it, and advanced a
considerable sum to enable him to make the necessary preparations
for a new voyage. Phipps soon collected the remainder;
and in 1687 set sail in a ship of two hundred tons
burthen to try his fortune once more, having previously engaged
to divide the profit according to the twenty shares of
which the subscription consisted. At first, all his labour
proved fruitless; but at last, when his patience was almost entirely
exhausted, he was so lucky as to bring up, from the depth
of six or seven fathoms, so much treasure, that he returned to
England with the value of two hundred thousand pounds
sterling. Of this sum he himself got about sixteen, others
say twenty thousand, and the duke ninety thousand pounds.
After he came back, some persons endeavoured to persuade
the king to seize both the ship and the cargo, under a pretence
that Phipps, when he solicited for his Majesty’s permission,
had not given accurate information respecting the business.
But the king answered, with much greatness of mind,
that he knew Phipps to be an honest man, and that he and
his friends should share the whole among them, had he returned
with double the value. His Majesty even conferred
upon him the honour of knighthood, to show how much he
was satisfied with his conduct. This Phipps was afterwards
high sheriff of New England, and died at London, greatly respected,
in 1693. This affair was attended with such good
consequences to the duke of Albemarle, that he obtained
from the king the governorship of Jamaica, in order to try
his fortune with other ships sunk in that neighbourhood.
But whether it was that the gold had been already taken
from the one before-mentioned, or that, when the vessel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
went to pieces, the sea had dispersed the cargo, it is certain
that nothing further was found worth the labour of searching
<span class="locked">for<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">289</a></span>.</p>

<p>In England, however, several companies were formed, and
obtained exclusive privileges of fishing up goods on certain
coasts, by means of divers. The most considerable of these
was that which, in 1688, tried its success at the Isle of Mull,
and at the head of which was the earl of Argyle. The divers
went down to the depth of sixty feet under water, remained
there sometimes a whole hour, and brought up gold chains,
money, and other articles, which, however, when collected,
were of very little <span class="locked">importance<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">290</a></span>. Without giving more examples
of the use of the diving-bell, I shall now mention some
of those who, in later times, have endeavoured to improve it.
That this machine was very little known in the first half of
the sixteenth century, I conclude from the following circumstance.
To the oldest edition of Vegetius on the art of war,
there are added, by the editor, some figures, of which no explanation
is given in the book. Among these is represented
a method of catching fish with the hands, at the bottom of
the sea. The apparatus for this purpose consists of a cap,
which is fitted so closely to the head of the diver that no
water can make its way between; and from the cap there
ascends a long leather pipe, the opening of which floats on
the surface of the water. Had the person who drew these
figures been acquainted with the diving-bell, he would certainly
have delineated it rather than this useless <span class="locked">apparatus<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">291</a></span>.
Of the old figures of a diving machine, that which approaches
nearest to the diving-bell is in a book on fortification, by Lorini;
who describes a square box bound round with iron,
which is furnished with windows, and has a stool affixed to it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
for the diver. This more ingenious contrivance appears, however,
to be older than that Italian; at least he does not pretend
to be the inventor of <span class="locked">it<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">292</a></span>.</p>

<p>In the year 1617, Francis Kessler gave a description of his
<span class="locked">water-armour<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">293</a></span>, intended also for diving, but which cannot
really be used for that <span class="locked">purpose<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">294</a></span>. In the year 1671, Witsen
taught, in a better manner than any of his predecessors, the
construction and use of the <span class="locked">diving-bell<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">295</a></span>; but he is much mistaken
when he says that it was invented at Amsterdam. In
1679 appeared, for the first time, Borelli’s well-known work
De Motu <span class="locked">Animalium<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">296</a></span>, in which he not only described the
diving-bell, but also proposed another, the impracticability of
which was shown by James <span class="locked">Bernoulli<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">297</a></span>. When Sturm published
his Collegium Curiosum, in 1678, he proposed some
hints for the improvement of this machine, on which remarks
were made in the Journal des Sçavans (Jan. 1678). None,
however, have carried their researches further for this purpose
than Dr. Halley, and Triewald, a Swede.</p>

<p>The bell which Edmund Halley, secretary to the Royal
Society, caused to be made, was three feet broad at the top,
five feet at the bottom, and eight feet in height; forming a
cavity of sixty-three cubic feet. It was covered with lead;
and was so heavy that it sunk to the bottom, even when entirely
empty. Around the lower edge, weights were disposed
in such a manner that it should always sink in a perpendicular
direction, and never remain in an oblique position. In the
top was fixed a piece of strong glass to admit the light from
above, and likewise a valve to give a passage to the air corrupted
by the breath. Around the whole circumference of
the bottom was placed a seat, on which the divers sat; and a
stool, fixed to ropes, hung below, on which they could stand
in order to work. The whole machine was suspended from a
cross beam fastened to the mast of a ship, so that it could be
easily lowered down into the water and again drawn up. That
the bell might be supplied with fresh air under the water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
large vessels filled with air, and which had an opening below
through which the water compressed the included air, were
let down by ropes. In the top of these vessels were leather
pipes, besmeared with oil, through which the diver introduced
air from the vessels into the bell; and as soon as a vessel was
emptied, it was drawn up, on a signal made by the diver, and
another let down. The foul air in the bell, being the warmest
and lightest, rose to the top of the machine, where it was suffered
to escape through the valve before-mentioned. By
these means the bell could be continually supplied with fresh
air in such abundance, that Halley, and four other persons,
remained under water, at the depth of ten fathoms, an hour
and a half, without suffering the least injury, and could, with
equal security, have continued longer, or even as long as they
might have wished. This precaution, however, is necessary,
that the bell be let down at first very slowly, that the divers
may be gradually accustomed to inspire the compressed air;
and at every twelve fathoms the bell must be held fast, in
order to expel the water which has rushed in, by letting fresh
air into it. By such apparatus, Halley was enabled to make
the bottom of the sea, within the circumference of the bell, so
dry that the sand or mud did not rise above his shoe.
Through the window, in the top, so much light was admitted,
that when the sea was still and the waves did not roll, he
could see perfectly well to read and write under the water.
When the empty air-vessels were drawn up, he sent up with
them his orders, written with an iron spike on a plate of lead,
and could thus let those above know when he wished to be
removed with the bell to another place. In bad weather, and
when the sea was rough, it was as dark under the bell as at
night; he then kindled a light; but a burning candle consumed
as much air as a man. The only inconvenience of
which Halley complained was, that, in going down, he felt a
pain in his ears, as if a sharp quill had been thrust into them.
This pain returned every time the bell was let down to a
greater depth, but soon went off again. A diver thought to
prevent this pain by putting chewed paper into both his ears;
but the bits of paper were forced in so far by the air, that a
surgeon found great difficulty to extract them.</p>

<p>Another improvement of the diving-bell was effected by the
well-known Triewald, a Swede, in 1732. His bell, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
much smaller and more commodious, was made of copper,
tinned in the inside. On the top there were panes of glass,
which, for the greater security, were fixed in a frame of the
same metal. The stool below was placed in such a manner,
that the head only of the diver, when he stood upon it, rose
above the surface of the water in the bell. This situation is
much better than when the whole body is raised above the
water in the bell, because near the surface of the water the
air is much cooler and fitter to breathe in than at the top of
the machine. That the diver also might remain conveniently
in the upper part of the bell, Triewald arranged his apparatus
so that when the diver had breathed as long as possible in the
upper air, he found at the side of the bell a spiral pipe, through
which he could draw in the lower cool air which was over the
surface of the water. To the upper end of this copper pipe
was affixed a pliable leather one, with an ivory mouth-piece,
which the diver put into his mouth, and could thus inspire
fresh air, in whatever position his body might <span class="locked">be<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">298</a></span>.</p>

<p>[In 1776, Mr. Spalding of Edinburgh made some improvements
in Dr. Halley’s diving-bell, for which he was rewarded
by the Society of Arts. His diving-bell was made of wood,
and was so light, that, with the divers and the weights attached
to its rim, it would not sink; the weight necessary to counteract
its buoyancy being added in the form of a large balance-weight,
suspended from its centre by a rope, which was so
mounted on pulleys that the divers could either draw the
balance-weight up to the mouth of the bell or allow it to fall
a considerable depth below it. Thus by letting the weight
down to the bottom, the divers could, as it were, anchor the
bell at any required level, or prevent its further descent if
they perceived a rock or part of a wreck beneath it, which
might otherwise overturn it. Also, by hauling in the rope
while the weight was at the bottom, the persons in the bell
might lower themselves at pleasure. Another improvement
consisted in the addition of a horizontal partition near the top
of the bell, which divided off a chamber, that might, by suitable
openings and valves, be filled either with water or with
air from the lower part of the bell, so as to alter the specific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
gravity of the whole machine, and thereby cause it to ascend
or descend at pleasure. The bell was supplied with air by an
apparatus resembling that of Dr. Halley, and ropes stretched
across the bell were used instead of seats and platforms for
standing on. Thus the persons in the diving-bell were enabled,
in case of accident, to raise themselves to the surface
without any assistance from above, and it was rendered so
perfectly manageable, that it might be removed to a considerable
distance from the point at which it descended; its
outward motion and its return to the vessel for the purpose of
being hauled up, being assisted by a long boat, which carried
the signal lines and the tackle for working the air-barrels.</p>

<p>Mr. John Farey, junior, made an improvement in Spalding’s
<span class="locked">apparatus<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">299</a></span>. The upper chamber of the diving-bell is very
strong and air-tight, without any openings for the admission
of water. Two pumps are fixed in the partition, by which air
may be forced into the upper chamber, whenever, during a
pause in the descent, the lower chamber or the cavity of the
bell is replenished with air. By this means, the upper chamber
is made a reservoir of condensed air, from which the bell may
be replenished with air, when it is desired to increase its
buoyancy, by forcing out the water from the lower part.
Hence also, the buoyancy of the bell may be at any time diminished,
by pumping some of the air from it into the upper
chamber, whereby the water will be allowed to enter to a
greater height; and as this is effected without wasting the air,
there is no danger of diminishing the buoyancy of the machine
to a degree which would prevent it from rising, in case the
suspending rope or chain should break.</p>

<p>Smeaton first employed the diving-bell in civil engineering
operations in repairing the foundations of Hexham bridge in
1779. The bell was made of wood, and was supplied with
air by means of a forcing-pump, which was fixed to the top,
and threw in a gallon of air at a time; the river being shallow,
the top of the bell was not covered with <span class="locked">water<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">300</a></span>. In 1788 he
used a cast-iron one in repairing Ramsgate harbour; a forcing-pump
in a boat supplied air through a flexible tube. Since
that time it has been frequently used by Rennie and others in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
submarine operations, recovering property from wrecks, blasting,
&amp;c. Mr. Rennie has moreover constructed apparatus for
moving the bell in any direction.</p>

<p>In addition to the various forms of diving-bell, different
water- and air-tight dresses have been invented to enable
divers to remain in the water and perform various operations.
Thus, Dr. Halley invented a leaden cap which covered the
diver’s head; it had glass before it, and contained as much air
as was sufficient for two minutes, and had affixed to it a thick
pliable pipe, with the other end fastened to the bell, and which,
at the cap, was furnished with a valve to convey fresh air to
the diver from the bell. This pipe, which the diver was
obliged to wind round his arm, served him also as a guide to
find his way back to the <span class="locked">bell<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">301</a></span>.</p>

<p>Mr. Martin states that a gentleman at Newton-Bushel, in
Devonshire, invented an apparatus consisting of a large case
of strong leather, holding about half a hogshead of air, made
perfectly water-tight, and adapted to the legs and arms, with
a glass in the anterior part, so that when the case was put on,
he could walk about very easily at the bottom of the sea, and
go into the cabin and other parts of a ship in a wreck, and
deliver out the goods; and that he practised this method for
forty years, and thereby acquired a large fortune and equal
<span class="locked">fame<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">302</a></span>.</p>

<p>M. Klingert also invented a similar kind of apparatus, and
described it in a pamphlet published at Breslau in 1798. The
armour was made of tin-plate, in the form of a cylinder, with
a round end to enclose the head and body; also, a leather
jacket with short sleeves, and a pair of water-tight drawers
of the same, buttoned on the metal part, where they joined,
and were made tight by brass hoops. Two distinct flexible
pipes terminated in the helmet, and rose to the surface of the
water; one was for inhaling, and terminated in an ivory mouth-piece,
the other was for the escape of foul air. The body
was kept down by weights.</p>

<p>Another method of supplying air to the apparatus was used
by Mr. Tonkin in 1804. This consisted in the application of
a bellows or pump, until the elastic force of the air was equal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
to the pressure of the water, the foul air being allowed to
escape into the water through a valve, or conducted to the
surface by a <span class="locked">pipe<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">303</a></span>.]</p>

of the Rhine, in the midst of the water, without wetting one’s clothes, or
any part of one’s body, and even carry a lighted candle to the bottom of
the water, they would consider it as altogether ridiculous and impossible.
This, however, I saw done at Toledo, in Spain, in the year 1538, before the
emperor Charles V. and almost ten thousand spectators. The experiment
was made by two Greeks, who taking a very large kettle, suspended from
ropes with the mouth downwards, fixed beams and planks in the middle of
its concavity, upon which they placed themselves, together with a candle.
The kettle was equipoised by means of lead fixed round its mouth, so that
when let down towards the water no part of its circumference should touch
the water sooner than another, else the water might easily have overcome the
air included in it, and have converted it into moist vapour. If a vessel thus
prepared be let down gently, and with due care, to the water, the included
air with great force makes way for itself through the resisting fluid. Thus
the men enclosed in it remain dry, in the midst of the water, for a little
while, until, in the course of time, the included air becomes weakened by
repeated aspiration, and is at length resolved into gross vapours, being consumed
by the greater moisture of the water: but if the vessel be gently
drawn up, the men continue dry, and the candle is found burning.”&mdash;Taisneri

let down equally to the surface of the water, and thus carried with it to
the bottom of the sea the whole air it contained. It stood upon three feet,

<h2 id="coloured">COLOURED GLASS.&mdash;ARTIFICIAL GEMS.</h2>

<p>It is probable that there was no great interval between the
discovery of the art of making glass, and that of giving it different
colours. When the substance of which it is formed
contains, by accident, any metallic particles, the glass assumes
some tint; and this happens oftener than is wished; nay, a
considerable degree of foresight is necessary to produce glass
perfectly colourless; and I am of opinion that this skill has
not been attained till a late period in the progress of the art.
Even in Pliny’s time the highest value was set upon glass entirely
free from colour, and transparent, or, as it was called,
<span class="locked">crystal<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">304</a></span>. From the different colours which glass acquired of
itself, it was easy to conceive the idea of giving it the tinge of
some precious stone: and this art, in ancient times, was carried
to a very great extent. Proofs of this may be found in
Pliny, who, besides others, mentions artificial hyacinths,
sapphires, and that black glass which approached very near to
the obsidian stone, and which in more than one place he calls
<i>gemmæ vitreæ</i><a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">305</a>. Trebellius Pollio relates in how whimsical a
manner Gallienus punished a cheat who had sold to his wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
a piece of glass for a <span class="locked">jewel<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">306</a></span>: and Tertullian ridicules the folly
of paying as dear for coloured glass as for real pearls. The
glass-houses at Alexandria were celebrated among the ancients
for the skill and ingenuity of the workmen employed in
them. From these, the Romans, who did not acquire a knowledge
of that art till a late period, procured for a long time all
their glass ware. The learned author of Recherches sur les
Égyptiens et les Chinois, in the end of his first volume, relates
more of these glass-houses than I know where to find in the
works of the ancients; but it is certain that coloured glass
was made even in those early ages. The emperor Adrian received
as a present from an Egyptian priest, several glass cups
which sparkled with colours of every kind, and which, as costly
wares, he ordered to be used only on grand <span class="locked">festivals<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">307</a></span>. Strabo
tells us, that a glass-maker in Alexandria informed him that
an earth was found in Egypt, without which the valuable
coloured glass could not be <span class="locked">made<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">308</a></span>.</p>

<p>Seneca, in his ninetieth epistle, in which he judges too philosophically,
that is, with too little knowledge of the world,
in regard to the value of labour, mentions one Democritus
who had discovered the art of making artificial <span class="locked">emeralds<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">309</a></span>; but
in my opinion this discovery consisted in giving a green
colour by cementation to the natural rock crystal: and this
art I imagine was treated of in that book, the name of which
Pliny, through an over-anxious care lest the deception should
become common, does not <span class="locked">mention<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">310</a></span>. For colouring crystal
and glass, so as to resemble stones, <span class="locked">Porta<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">311</a></span>, <span class="locked">Neri<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">312</a></span>, and others
have, in modern times, given directions which are, however,
not much used, because the crystal is thereby liable to acquire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
so many flaws that it cannot be easily cut afterwards, though,
as Neri assures us, these by attention may sometimes be
avoided.</p>

<p>It is worthy of remark, that in some collections of antiquities
at Rome, there are pieces of coloured glass which were
once used as jewels. In the Museum Victorium, for example,
there are shown a chrysolite and an emerald, both of which
are so well executed, that they are not only perfectly transparent
and coloured throughout, but neither externally nor
internally have the smallest blemish, which certainly could
not be guarded against without great care and skill.</p>

<p>What materials the ancients used for colouring glass, has
not been told to us by any of their writers. It is, however,
certain that metallic oxides only can be employed for that
purpose, because these pigments withstand the heat of the
glass furnaces; and it is highly probable that ferruginous
earth, if not the sole, was at least the principal substance, by
which not only all shades of red, violet, and yellow, but even
a blue colour, could be communicated, as Professor Gmelin
has <span class="locked">shown<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">313</a></span>. Respecting the red, of which only I mean here
to speak, there is the less doubt, as, at present, sometimes an
artificial, and sometimes a natural, iron ochre is often employed
for that purpose. For common works this is sufficient;
but when pure clear glass, coloured strongly throughout with
a beautiful lively red, free from flaws, and in somewhat large
pieces, is required, iron is not fit, because its colour, by the
continued heat necessary for making glass, either disappears
or becomes dirty and almost <span class="locked">blackish<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">314</a></span>.</p>

<p id="rubies">In the last century, some artists in Germany first fell upon
the method of employing gold instead of iron, and of thereby
making artificial rubies, which when they were well set could
deceive the eye of a connoisseur, unless he tried them with a
diamond or a file. The usual method was to dissolve the gold
in aqua regia, and to precipitate it by a solution of tin, when
it assumed the form of a purple-coloured powder. This substance,
which must be mixed with the best frit, is called the
precipitate of Cassius, gold-purple, or <span class="locked">mineral-purple<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">315</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
This Cassius, from whom it takes its name, was called
Andrew, and because both the father and the son had the same
christian name, they have been often confounded with each
other. The father was secretary to the duke of Schleswig,
and is not known as a man of letters; but the son is celebrated
as the inventor or preparer of the gold-purple, and of a bezoar-essence.
He took the degree of doctor at Leyden, in 1632,
practised physic at Hamburg, and was appointed physician
in ordinary to the bishop of Lubec. As far as I know, he
never published anything respecting his art; but this service
was rendered to the public by his son, who was born at Hamburg,
and resided as a physician at Lubec. He was the
author of a well-known treatise, now exceedingly scarce, entitled
Thoughts concerning that last and most perfect work
of nature, and chief of metals, gold, its wonderful properties,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
generation, affections, effects, and fitness for the operations of
art; illustrated by <span class="locked">experiments<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">316</a></span>.</p>

<p>From this work, it will be easily understood why the author
does not give himself out as the inventor of the <span class="locked">gold-purple<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">317</a></span>,
which he is commonly supposed to be, at which Lewis is much
astonished. It is seen also by it that Leibnitz calls him improperly
a physician at Hamburg, having probably confounded
the father and son <span class="locked">together<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">318</a></span>. Upon the whole, it is
not proved that any of the Cassius’s was the inventor of the
above precipitate, else it would certainly not have been <span class="locked">omitted<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">319</a></span>
in this treatise; and mention of gold-purple is to be found
in the works of several old <span class="locked">chemists<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">320</a></span>.</p>

<p>Something of this kind has, doubtless, been meant by the
old chemists, when they talk of red lions, the purple soul of
gold, and the golden mantle; but what they wished to conceal
under these metaphors, I am not able to conjecture. In the
year 1606, when Libavius published his Alchemy, the art of
making ruby-glass must have been unknown. He indeed
quotes an old receipt for making rubies; and conjectures, that
because the real stones of the same name are found in the
neighbourhood of gold mines, they may have acquired their
colour from that metal; and that by means of art, glass might
be coloured by a solution of <span class="locked">gold<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">321</a></span>. The later chemists, however,
and particularly Achard, found no traces of gold, but of
iron, in that precious <span class="locked">stone<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">322</a></span>.</p>

<p>Neri, who lived almost at the same time as <span class="locked">Libavius<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">323</a></span>, was
better acquainted with the gold-purple, though his receipt is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
very defective. According to his directions, the gold solution
must be evaporated, and the residue suffered to remain over
the fire until it becomes of a purple colour. One may readily
believe that this colour will be produced; but glass will
scarcely be coloured equally through by this powder, and
perhaps some of the gold particles will show themselves in it.
Kunkel affirms, and not without reason, that something more
is necessary to make rubies by means of gold; but he has not
thought proper to tell us what it <span class="locked">is<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">324</a></span>.</p>

<p>Glauber, who wrote his Philosophical <span class="locked">Furnace<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">325</a></span> about the middle
of the seventeenth century, appears to have made several experiments
with the gold-purple. He dissolved the metal in
aqua regia; precipitated it by liquor of flint, and melted into
glass the precipitate, which contained in it abundance of
vitreous <span class="locked">earth<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">326</a></span>.</p>

<p>None, however, in the seventeenth century, understood better
the use and preparation of gold-purple than John Kunkel, who,
after being ennobled by Charles XI., king of Sweden, assumed
the name of Löwenstiern. He himself tells us, that he made
artificial rubies in great abundance, and sold them by weight,
at a high price. He says, he made for the elector of Cologne
a cup of ruby-glass, weighing not less than twenty-four pounds,
which was a full inch in thickness, and of an equally beautiful
colour throughout. He employed himself most on this art
after he engaged in the service of Frederic William, elector
of Brandenburg, in the year 1679. At that time he was inspector
of the glass-houses at Potsdam; and, in order that the
art of making ruby-glass might be brought to perfection, the
elector expended 1600 ducats. A cup with a cover, of this
manufacture, is still preserved at Berlin. Kunkel, however,
has nowhere given a full account of this art. He has only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
left in his works a few scattered remarks, which Lewis has
<span class="locked">collected<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">327</a></span>.</p>

<p>In the year 1684, earlier than Cassius, John Christian
Orschal wrote his well-known work, Sol sine <span class="locked">veste<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">328</a></span>, in which
he treats, more intelligibly than any one before him, of the
manner of making ruby-glass. He, however, confesses that
Cassius first taught him to precipitate gold by means of tin;
that Cassius traded in glass coloured with this precipitate, and
that a good deal of coloured glass was then made at Freysingen,
but that the art was kept very secret. As Orschal
deserves that his fate should be better known, I shall here
mention the following few particulars respecting him. About
the year 1682 he was at Dresden, in the service of John
Henry Rudolf, from whom he learnt many chemical processes,
and particularly amalgamation, by which he gained money afterwards
in Bohemia. After this he was employed at the mines
in Hesse; but he brought great trouble upon himself by
polygamy and other irregularities, and died in a monastery in
Poland.</p>

<p>Christopher Grummet, who was Kunkel’s assistant, wrote,
in opposition to Orschal, his known treatise, Sol non sine
veste, which was printed at Rothenburg, in <span class="locked">1685<a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">329</a></span>. In like
manner, an anonymous author printed against Orschal, at
Cologne, in 1684, another work, in duodecimo, entitled
Apelles post tabulam observans maculas in Sole sine veste.
The dispute, however, was not so much concerning the use of
gold-purple, as the cause of the red colour, and the vitrification
of gold.</p>

<p>It is worthy of remark, that Kunkel affirms he could give
to glass a perfect ruby-red colour without gold; which Orschal
and most chemists have however doubted. It is nevertheless
said, that Krüger, who was inspector of the glass-houses at
Potsdam, under Frederic William king of Prussia, discovered
earlier the art of making ruby-glass without gold, and that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
cup and cover of cut glass made in this manner is still preserved
at Berlin.</p>

<p>Painting on glass and in enamel, and the preparation of
coloured materials for mosaic work, may, in certain respects,
be considered as branches of the art of colouring glass; and
in all these a beautiful red is the most difficult, the dearest,
and the scarcest. When the old master-pieces of painting on
glass are examined, it is found either that the panes have on
one side a transparent red varnish burnt into them, or that
the pieces which are stained through and through, are thinner
than those coloured in the other <span class="locked">manner<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">330</a></span>. It is therefore
extremely probable that the old artists, as they did not know
how to give to thick pieces a beautiful transparent red colour,
employed only iron, or manganese, which pigment, as already
observed, easily becomes in a strong heat blackish and <span class="locked">muddy<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">331</a></span>.
Enamel-painters, however, were for a long time obliged to be
contented with it. A red colour in mosaic work is attended
with less difficulty, because no transparency, nay rather opacity,
is required. At Rome those pieces are valued most which
have the beautiful shining red colour of the finest sealing-wax.
We are told by Ferber that such pieces were at one time
made only by a man named Mathioli, and out of a kind of
copper dross; at present (1792), there are several artists in
that city who prepare these materials, but they are not able
to give them a perfect high <span class="locked">colour<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">332</a></span>.</p>

<p>[Of late years the interesting art of painting on glass has
attracted considerable attention; lovers of the fine arts, antiquaries,
and chemists, have contributed to its perfection, and
have sought to ascertain by what methods their predecessors
were able to give those beautiful and brilliant tints to their
productions, many of which have been so wantonly destroyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
by the barbarity of the last <span class="locked">century<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">333</a></span>. One of the most ingenious
essays that has been written on the subject, is that
published by an anonymous correspondent in the Philosophical
Magazine for December 1836, which we subjoin in elucidation
of our present knowledge on the subject.</p>

<h3><i>On the Art of Glass-Painting.</i> <i>By</i> a Correspondent.</h3>

<p>It is a singular fact, that the art of glass-painting, practised
with such success during the former ages from one end of
Europe to the other, should gradually have fallen into such
disuse, that in the beginning of the last century it came to be
generally considered as a lost art. In the course of the
eighteenth century, however, the art again began to attract
attention, and many attempts were made to revive it. It was
soon found by modern artists, that by employing the processes
always in use among enamel-painters, the works of the old
painters on glass might in most respects be successfully imitated;
but they were totally unable to produce any imitation
whatever of that glowing red which sheds such incomparable
brilliancy over the ancient windows that still adorn so many
of our <span class="locked">churches<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">334</a></span>. For this splendid colour they possessed no
substitute, until a property, peculiar to silver alone among all
the metals, was discovered, which will presently be described.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
The art of enamelling on glass differs little from the well-known
art of enamelling on other substances. The colouring materials
(which are exclusively metallic) are prepared by being ground
up with a <i>flux</i>, that is, a very fusible glass, composed of silex,
flint-glass, lead, and borax: the colour with its flux is then
mixed with volatile oil, and laid on with the brush. The pane
of glass thus enamelled is then exposed to a dull red heat,
just sufficient to soften and unite together the particles of the
flux, by which means the colour is perfectly fixed on the glass.
Treated in this way, gold yields a purple, gold and silver mixed
a rose-colour, iron a brick-red, cobalt a <span class="locked">blue<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">335</a></span>; mixtures of
iron, copper and manganese, brown and black. Copper, which
yields the green in common <span class="locked">enamel-painting<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">336</a></span>, is not found to
produce a fine colour when applied in the same way to glass,
and viewed by transmitted light; for a green therefore recourse
is often had to glass coloured blue on one side and yellow on
the other. To obtain a yellow, silver is employed, which,
either in the metallic or in any other form, possesses the singular
property of imparting a transparent stain, when exposed
to a low red heat in contact with glass. This stain is either
yellow, orange, or red, according to circumstances. For this
purpose no flux is used: the prepared silver is merely ground
up with ochre or clay, and applied in a thick layer upon the
glass. When removed from the furnace the silver is found
not at all adhering to the glass; it is easily scraped off, leaving
a transparent stain, which penetrates to a certain depth. If a
large proportion of ochre has been employed, the stain is yellow;
if a small proportion, it is orange-coloured; and by repeated
exposure to the fire, without any additional colouring matter,
the orange may be converted into red. This conversion of
orange into red is, I believe, a matter of much nicety, in which
experience only can ensure success. Till within a few years
this was the only bright red in use among modern glass-painters;
and though the best specimens certainly produce a
fine effect, yet it will seldom bear comparison with the red
employed in such profusion by the old artists.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
Besides the enamels and stains above-described, artists,
whenever the subject will allow of it, make use of panes coloured
throughout their substance in the glass-house melting-pot,
because the perfect transparency of such glass gives a
brilliancy of effect, which enamel-colouring, always more or
less opake, cannot equal. It was to a glass of this kind that
the old glass-painters owed their splendid red. This in fact is
the only point in which the modern and ancient processes
differ, and this is the only part of the art which was ever really
lost. Instead of blowing plates of solid red, the old glass-makers
used to <i>flash</i> a thin layer of red over a substratum of
plain glass. Their process must have been to melt side by side
in the glass-house a pot of plain and a pot of red glass: then
the workman, by dipping his rod first into the plain and then
into the red glass pot, obtained a lump of plain glass covered
with a coating of red, which, by dexterous management in
blowing and whirling, he extended into a plate, exhibiting on
its surface a very thin stratum of the desired <span class="locked">colour<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">337</a></span>. In this
state the glass came into the hands of the glass-painter, and
answered most of his purposes, except when the subject required
the representation of white or other colours on a red
ground: in this case it became necessary to employ a machine
like the lapidary’s wheel, partially to grind away the coloured
surface till the white substratum appeared.</p>

<p>The material employed by the old glass-makers to tinge
their glass red was the protoxide of copper, but on the discontinuance
of the art of glass-painting the dependent manufacture
of red glass of course ceased, and all knowledge of the art became
so entirely extinct, that the notion generally prevailed
that the colour in question was derived from <span class="locked">gold<a name="FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">338</a></span>. It is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
a little remarkable that the knowledge of the copper-red should
have been so entirely lost, though printed receipts have always
existed detailing the whole process. Baptista Porta (born
about 1540) gives a receipt in his Magia Naturalis, noticing
at the same time the difficulty of success. Several receipts are
found in the compilations of Neri, Merret and Kunckel, from
whence they have been copied into our Encyclopædias<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">339</a>. None
of these receipts however state to what purposes the red glass
was applied, nor do they make any mention of the <i>flashing</i>.
The difficulty of the art consists in the proneness of the copper
to pass from the state of protoxide into that of peroxide, in
which latter state it tinges glass green. In order to preserve
it in the state of protoxide, these receipts prescribe various deoxygenating
substances to be stirred into the melted glass,
such as smiths’ clinkers, tartar, soot, rotten wood, and cinnabar.</p>

<p>One curious circumstance deserves to be noticed, which is,
that glass containing copper when removed from the melting-pot
sometimes only exhibits a faint greenish tinge, yet in this
state nothing more than simple exposure to a gentle heat is requisite
to throw out a brilliant red. This change of colour is
very remarkable, as it is obvious that no change of oxygenation
can possibly take place during the <i>recuisson</i>.</p>

<p>The art of tinging glass by protoxide of copper and flashing
it on crown-glass, has of late years been revived by the Tyne
Company in England, at Choisy in <span class="locked">France<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">340</a></span>, and in Suabia in
Germany, and in 1827 the Academy of Arts at Berlin gave a
premium for an imperfect receipt. To what extent modern
glass-painters make use of these new glasses I am ignorant;
the specimens that I have seen were so strongly coloured as
to be in parts almost opake, but this is a defect which might
no doubt be easily <span class="locked">remedied<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">341</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
I shall now conclude these observations by a few notices
respecting glass tinged by fusion with gold, which, though
never brought into general use among glass-painters, has I
know been employed in one or two instances, flashed both on
crown- and on flint-glass. Not long after the time when the
art of making the copper-red glass was lost, Kunkel appears
to have discovered that gold melted with flint-glass was capable
of imparting to it a beautiful ruby colour. As he derived
much profit from the invention, he kept his method secret,
and his successors have done the same to the present day.
The art, however, has been practised ever since for the purpose
of imitating precious stones, &amp;c., and the glass used to
be sold at Birmingham for a high price under the name of
<i>Jew’s glass</i>. The rose-coloured scent-bottles, &amp;c., now commonly
made, are composed of plain glass flashed or coated with
a very thin layer of the glass in question. I have myself made
numerous experiments on this subject, and have been completely,
and at last uniformly, successful, in producing glass
of a fine crimson colour. One cause why so many persons
have failed in the same <span class="locked">attempt<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">342</a></span>, I suspect is that they have
used too large a proportion of gold; for it is a fact, that an additional
quantity of gold, beyond a certain point, far from deepening
the colour, actually destroys it altogether. Another cause
probably is, that they have not employed a sufficient degree of
heat in the fusion. I have found that a degree of heat, which
I judged sufficient to melt cast-iron, is not strong enough to
injure the colour. It would appear, that in order to receive
the colour, it is necessary that the glass should contain a proportion
either of lead, or of some other metallic glass. I have
found bismuth, zinc, and antimony to answer the purpose,
but have in vain attempted to impart any tinge of this colour
to crown-glass alone.</p>

<p>Glass containing gold exhibits the same singular change of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
colour on being exposed to a gentle heat, as has been already
noticed with respect to glass containing <span class="locked">copper<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">343</a></span>. The former
when taken from the crucible is generally of a pale rose-colour,
but sometimes colourless as water, and does not assume its
ruby colour till it has been exposed to a low red-heat, either
under a muffle or in the lamp. Great care must be taken in
this operation, for a slight excess of fire destroys the colour,
leaving the glass of a dingy brown, but with a blue transparency
like that of gold-leaf. These changes of colour have
been vaguely attributed to change of oxygenation in the gold;
but it is obviously impossible that mere exposure to a gentle
heat can effect any chemical change in the interior of a solid
mass of glass, which has already undergone a heat far more
intense. In fact I have found that metallic gold gives the red
colour as well as the oxide, and it appears scarcely to admit
of a doubt, that in a metal so easily reduced, the whole of the
oxygen must be expelled long before the glass has reached its
melting-point. It has long been known that silver yields its
colour to glass while in the metallic state, and everything leads
one to suppose that the case is the same as to gold.</p>

<p>There is still one other substance by means of which I find
it is possible to give a red colour to glass, and that is a compound
of tin, chromic acid, and lime; but my trials do not lead
me to suppose that glass thus coloured will ever be brought
into use.</p>

<p>With respect to the production of artificial gems, they are
now made abundantly of almost every shade of colour, closely
approximating to those which occur in nature, excepting in
hardness and refractive power. They are formed by fusing
what is called a base with various metallic oxides. The base
varies in composition: thus, M. Fontanieu makes his by fusing
silica with carbonate of potash, carbonate of lead and borax.
M. Donault Wieland’s consists of silica, potash, borax, oxide of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
lead, and sometimes arsenious acid. Hence the base differs
but little in composition from glass. By fusing the base with
metallic oxides, the former acquires various tints. Thus with
oxide of antimony the oriental topaz is prepared; with oxide
of manganese and a little purple of cassius, the amethyst;
with antimony and a very small quantity of cobalt, the beryl;
with horn silver (chloride of silver), the diamond and opal:
the oriental ruby is prepared from the base, the purple of
cassius, peroxide of iron, golden sulphuret of antimony, manganese
calcined with nitre and rock crystal.]</p>

<p class="fn3"><a name="Footnote_315" id="Footnote_315" href="#FNanchor_315" class="fnanchor">315</a>  [The extensive use of this substance in colouring glass and porcelain
has rendered its best and most œconomical preparation a subject of interest
both to the chemist and the manufacturer. Although the determination
of its true chemical composition has presented obstacles almost insuperable,
still many important points with regard to its manufacture have been
elucidated. It has been found that the tin salt used in precipitating it
must contain both the binoxide and protoxide of tin in certain proportions,
and it has been also discovered that the degree of dilution both of the gold
and tin solutions exerts a very perceptible influence on the beauty of the
preparation. Capaun has examined this latter point with great attention,
by testing all the different products as to their power of colouring glass.
</p>
<p>
The first point to be attained is the preparation of a solution of sesquioxide
of tin; and for this purpose Bolley proposes to employ the double
compound of bichloride of tin with sal-ammoniac (pink salt). This salt is
not altered by exposure to the atmosphere, and contains a fixed and known
quantity of bichloride of tin, and when boiled with metallic tin it takes up
so much as will form the protochloride; as the exact quantity of the bichloride
is known, it is very easy to use exactly such a quantity of tin as
will serve to form the sesquichloride. 100 parts of the pink salt require
for this purpose 10·7 parts of metallic tin.
</p>
<p>
Capaun recommends dissolving 1·34 gr. of gold in aqua regia, an excess
being carefully avoided, and diluting the solution with 480 grs. of water.
10 grs. of pink salt are mixed with 1·07 gr. of tin filings and 40 grs. of
water, and the whole boiled till the tin is dissolved. 140 grs. of water are
then added to this, and the solution gradually mixed with the gold liquor,
slightly warmed, until no more precipitation ensues. The precipitate washed
and dried weighs 4·92 grs. and is of a dark brown colour.
</p>
<p>
M. Figuier states, as the results of his investigations, that the purple of
Cassius is a perfectly definite combination of protoxide of gold and of stannic
acid, or peroxide of tin, the proof of which is, that it is instantly produced
when protoxide of gold and peroxide of tin are placed in contact.]</p></div>

swept away, and the present plain windows inserted in their place. The
glass lay for a long time afterwards in baskets on the floor; and when the
greater part of it had been purloined the remainder was locked up in the
Galilee.” And in 1802 a beautiful ancient structure, the Great Vestry,

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="sealing">SEALING-WAX.</h2>

<p>Writers on diplomatics mention, besides metals, five other
substances on which impressions were made, or with which
letters and public acts were sealed, viz. <i>terra sigillaris</i>, cement,
paste, common wax, and <span class="locked">sealing-wax<a name="FNanchor_344" id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">344</a></span>. The <i>terra sigillaris</i>
was used by the Egyptians, and appears to have been the first
substance employed for <span class="locked">sealing<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">345</a></span>. The Egyptian priests bound
to the horns of the cattle fit for sacrifice a piece of paper;
stuck upon it some sealing-earth, on which they made an impression
with their seal; and such cattle only could be offered
up as <span class="locked">victims<a name="FNanchor_346" id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">346</a></span>.</p>

<p>Lucian speaks of a fortune-teller who ordered those who
came to consult him to write down on a bit of paper the questions
they wished to ask, to fold it up, and to seal it with clay,
or any other substance of the like <span class="locked">kind<a name="FNanchor_347" id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">347</a></span>. Such earth seems
to have been employed in sealing by the Byzantine emperors:
for we are told that at the second council of Nice, a certain
person defended the worship of images by saying, no one believed
that those who received written orders from the emperor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
and venerated the seal, worshiped on that account the sealing-earth,
the paper, or the <span class="locked">lead<a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">348</a></span>.</p>

<p>Cicero relates that Verres having seen in the hands of one
of his servants a letter written to him from Agrigentum, and
having observed on it an impression in sealing-earth (<i>cretula</i>),
he was so pleased with it that he caused the seal-ring with
which it was made to be taken from the <span class="locked">possessor<a name="FNanchor_349" id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">349</a></span>. The same
orator, in his defence of Flaccus, produced an attestation sent
from Asia, and proved its authenticity by its being sealed with
Asiatic sealing-earth; with which, said he to the auditors, as
you daily see, all public and private letters in Asia are sealed:
and he showed on the other hand that the testimony brought
by the accuser was false, because it was sealed with wax, and
for that reason could not have come from <span class="locked">Asia<a name="FNanchor_350" id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">350</a></span>. The scholiast
Servius relates, that a sibyl received a promise from Apollo,
that she should live as long as she did not see the earth of
the island Erythræa where she resided; that she therefore
quitted the place, and retired to Cumæ, where she became
old and decrepid; but that having received a letter sealed
with Erythræan earth (<i>creta</i>), when she saw the seal she
instantly <span class="locked">expired<a name="FNanchor_351" id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">351</a></span>.</p>

<p>No one however will suppose that this earth was the same
as that to which we at present give the name of <i>creta</i>, chalk;
for if it was a natural earth it must have been of that kind
called potters’ clay, as that clay is capable of receiving an impression
and of retaining it after it is hardened by drying.
That the Romans, under the indefinite name of <i>creta</i>, often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
understood a kind of potters’ earth, can be proved by many
passages of their writers. Columella speaks of a kind of chalk
of which wine-jars and dishes were <span class="locked">made<a name="FNanchor_352" id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">352</a></span>. Virgil calls it
<span class="locked">tough<a name="FNanchor_353" id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">353</a></span>; and the ancient writers on agriculture give the same
name to marl which was employed to manure <span class="locked">land<a name="FNanchor_354" id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">354</a></span>. Notwithstanding
all these authorities, I do not clearly comprehend
how letters could be sealed with potters’ clay, as it does not
adhere with sufficient force either to linen, of which in ancient
times the covers of letters were made, or to parchment; as it
must be laid on very thick to have a distinct impression; as
it is long in drying, and is again easily softened by moisture;
and, at any rate, if conveyed by post at present, it would be
crumbled into dust in going only from Hamburg to Altona.
I can readily believe that the Roman messengers employed
more skill and attention to preserve the letters committed to
their care than are employed by our postmen; but the distance
from Asia to Rome is much greater than that from Hamburg
to Altona.</p>

<p>But may there not be as little foundation for the ancient
expression <i>creta Asiatica</i>, Asiatic earth, as for the modern
expression, <i>cera Hispanica</i>, Spanish wax? May not the former
have signified a kind of coarse artificial cement? These
questions might be answered by those who have had an opportunity
of examining or only seeing the <i>sigilla cretacea</i> in
collections of antiquities. We are assured that such are still
preserved; at least we find in <span class="locked">Ficoroni<a name="FNanchor_355" id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">355</a></span> the representation of
six impressions which, as he tells us, consisted of that earth.
In that author however I find nothing to clear up my doubts;
he says only that some of these seals were white; others of a
gray colour, like ashes; others red, and others brown. They
seem all to have been enclosed in leaden cases. Could it be
proved that each letter was wrapped round with a thread, and
that the thread, as in the seals affixed to diplomas, was drawn
through the covering of the seal, the difficulty which I think
occurs in the use of these earths, as mentioned by the ancients,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
would entirely <span class="locked">disappear<a name="FNanchor_356" id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">356</a></span>. It seems to me remarkable that
neither Theophrastus nor Pliny says anything of the Asiatic
<i>creta</i>, or speaks at all of sealing-earth; though they have
carefully enumerated all those kinds of earth which were worth
notice on account of any use.</p>

<p>In Europe, as far as I know, wax has been everywhere used
for sealing since the earliest ages. Writers on diplomatics,
however, are not agreed whether yellow or white wax was first
employed; but it appears that the former, on account of its
low price, must have been first and principally used, at least
by private persons. It is probable also, that the seals of
diplomas were more durable when they consisted of yellow
wax; for it is certain that white wax is rendered more brittle
and much less durable by the process of bleaching. Many
seals also may at present be considered white which were at
first yellow; for not only does wax highly bleached resume
in time a dirty yellow colour, but yellow wax also in the course
of years loses so much of its colour as to become almost like
white wax. This perhaps may account for the oldest seals
appearing to be of white, and the more modern of yellow wax.
These however are conjectures which I submit with deference
to the determination of those versed in diplomatics.</p>

<p>In the course of time wax was coloured red; and a good deal
later, at least in Germany, but not before the fourteenth century,
it was coloured green, and sometimes black. I find it
remarked that blue wax never appears on diplomas; and I
may indeed say it is impossible it should appear, for the art
of giving a blue colour to wax has never yet been discovered;
and in old books, such as that of Wecker, we find no receipt
for that purpose. Later authors have pretended to give directions
how to communicate that colour to wax, but they are
altogether false; for vegetable dyes when united with wax
become greenish, so that the wax almost resembles the hip-stone;
and earthy colours do not combine with it, but in
melting fall again to the bottom. A seal of blue wax, not
coloured blue merely on the outer surface, would be as great
a rarity in the arts as in diplomatics, and would afford matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
of speculation for our chemists; but I can give them no hopes
that such a thing can ever be <span class="locked">produced<a name="FNanchor_357" id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">357</a></span>. The emperor
Charles V. in the year 1524 granted to Dr. Stockamar of Nuremberg,
the privilege of using blue wax in seals;&mdash;a favour
like that conferred in 1704 on the manufactories in the principality
of Halberstadt and the county of Reinstein, to make
indigo from minerals. It was certainly as difficult for the
doctor to find blue wax for seals as for the proprietors of these
manufactories to discover indigo in the <span class="locked">earth<a name="FNanchor_358" id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">358</a></span>.</p>

<p>Much later are impressions made on paste or dough, which
perhaps could not be employed on the ancient parchment or
the linen covers of letters, though in Pliny’s time the paper
then in use was joined together with flour <span class="locked">paste<a name="FNanchor_359" id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">359</a></span>. Proper
diplomas were never sealed with wafers; and in the matchless
diplomatic collection of H. Gatterer there are no wafer-seals
much above two hundred years old. From that collection I
have now in my possession one of these seals, around the impression
of which is the following inscription, <i>Secretum civium
in Ulma, 1474</i>; but it is only a new copy of a very old impression.
Kings, however, before the invention of sealing-wax,
were accustomed to seal their letters with this <span class="locked">paste<a name="FNanchor_360" id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">360</a></span>.</p>

<p>Heineccius and others relate that <i>maltha</i> also was employed
for seals. This word signifies a kind of cement, formed chiefly
of inflammable substances, and used to make reservoirs, pipes,
&amp;c. water-tight. Directions how to prepare it may be found
in the writers on agriculture, Pliny, Festus and others. The
latter tells how to make it of a composition of pitch and <span class="locked">wax<a name="FNanchor_361" id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">361</a></span>:
but neither in that author nor in any other have I found
proofs that letters were sealed with it, or that seals of it were
affixed to diplomas: for the words of Pollux, “cera qua tabella
judicum <span class="locked">obliniebatur<a name="FNanchor_362" id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">362</a></span>,” will admit of a different explanation.
If maltha has been in reality used for seals, that mixture
may be considered as the first or oldest sealing-wax, as
what of it is still preserved has been composed of resinous
substances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
Some writers <span class="locked">assert<a name="FNanchor_363" id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">363</a></span>, upon the authority of <span class="locked">Lebeuf<a name="FNanchor_364" id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">364</a></span>, that
sealing-wax was invented about the year 1640 by a Frenchman
named Rousseau; but that author refers his readers to
<span class="locked">Papillon<a name="FNanchor_365" id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">365</a></span>, who refers again to <span class="locked">Pomet<a name="FNanchor_366" id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">366</a></span>, so that the last appears
to be the first person who broached that opinion. According
to his account, Francis Rousseau, born not far from Auxerre,
and who travelled a long time in Persia, Pegu and other parts
of the East Indies, and in 1692 resided in St. Domingo, was
the inventor of sealing-wax. Having, while he lived at Paris
as a merchant, during the latter years of the reign of Louis
XIII., who died in 1643, lost all his property by a fire, he
bethought himself of preparing sealing-wax from shell-lac, as
he had seen it prepared in India, in order to maintain his wife
and five children. A lady of the name of Longueville made
this wax known at court, and caused Louis XIII. to use it,
after which it was purchased and used throughout all Paris.
By this article, Rousseau, before the expiration of a year,
gained 50,000 livres. It acquired the name of <i>cire d’Espagne</i>,
Spanish wax, because at that time a kind of lac, which was
only once melted and coloured a little red, was called Portugal
wax, <i>cire de Portugal</i><a name="FNanchor_367" id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">367</a>.</p>

<p>That sealing-wax was either very little or not at all known
in Germany in the beginning of the sixteenth century, may be
concluded from its not being mentioned either by Porta or
Wecker; though in the works of both these authors there are
various receipts respecting common wax, and little known
methods of writing and <span class="locked">sealing<a name="FNanchor_368" id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">368</a></span>. The former says, that to
open letters in such a manner as not to be perceived, the wax<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
seal must be heated a little, and must be then carefully separated
from the letter by a horse’s hair; and when the letter
has been read and folded up, the seal must be again dexterously
fastened to it. This manœuvre, as the writers on diplomatics
remark, has been often made use of to forge public
acts; and they have therefore given directions how to discover
such <span class="locked">frauds<a name="FNanchor_369" id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">369</a></span>. The above method of opening letters, however,
can be applied only to common wax, and not to sealing-wax:
had the latter been used in Wecker’s time he would have
mentioned this <span class="locked">limitation<a name="FNanchor_370" id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">370</a></span>.</p>

<p>Whether sealing-wax was used earlier in the East Indies
than in Europe, as the French think, I cannot with certainty
determine. <span class="locked">Tavernier<a name="FNanchor_371" id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">371</a></span>, however, seems to say that the lac
produced in the kingdom of Assam is employed there not only
for lackering, but also for making Spanish sealing-wax. I
must confess also that I do not know whether the Turks and
other eastern nations use it in general. In the collection of
natural curiosities belonging to our university there are two
sticks of sealing-wax which Professor Butner procured from
Constantinople, under the name of Turkish wax. They are
angular, bent like a bow, are neither stamped nor glazed, and
are of a dark but pure red colour. Two other sticks which
came from the East Indies are straight, glazed, made somewhat
thin at both ends, have no stamp, and are of a darker
and dirtier red colour. All these four sticks seem to be lighter
than ours, and I perceive that by rubbing they do not acquire
so soon nor so strong an electrical quality as our German wax
of moderate fineness. But whether the first were made in
Turkey and the latter in the East Indies, or whether the whole
four were made in Europe, is not known. That sealing-wax
however was made and used in Germany a hundred years
before Rousseau’s time, and that the merit of that Frenchman
consisted probably only in this, that he first made it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
France, or made the first good wax, will appear in the course
of what follows.</p>

<p>The oldest known seal of our common sealing-wax is that
found by M. Roos, on a letter written from London, Aug. 3rd,
1554, to the rheingrave Philip Francis von Daun, by his agent
in England, Gerrard <span class="locked">Hermann<a name="FNanchor_372" id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">372</a></span>. The colour of the wax is a
dark-red; it is very shining, and the impression bears the
initials of the writer’s name G. H. The next seal, in the order
of time, is one of the year 1561, on a letter written to the council
of Gorlitz at Breslau. This letter was found among the
ancient records of Gorlitz by Dr. Anton, and is three times
sealed with beautiful red <span class="locked">wax<a name="FNanchor_373" id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">373</a></span>. Among the archives of the
before-mentioned family M. Roos found two other letters of
the year 1566, both addressed to the rheingrave Frederick
von Daun, from Orchamp in Picardy, by his steward Charles
de Pousol; the one dated September the 2nd, and the other
September the 7th. Another letter, written by the same person
to the same rheingrave, but dated Paris January 22nd,
1567, is likewise sealed with red wax, which is of a higher
colour, and appears to be of a coarser quality. As the oldest
seals of this kind came from France and England, M. Roos
conjectures that the invention, as the name seems to indicate,
belongs to the Spaniards. This conjecture appears to me
however improbable, especially as sealing-wax was used at
Breslau so early as 1561; but this matter can be best determined
perhaps by the Spanish literati. It is much to be lamented
that John Fenn, in his Original letters of the last half
of the fifteenth <span class="locked">century<a name="FNanchor_374" id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">374</a></span>, when he gives an account of the size
and shape of the seals, does not inform us of what substances
they are composed. Respecting a letter of the year 1455, he
says only, “The seal is of red wax;” by which is to be understood,
undoubtedly, common wax.</p>

<p>Among the records of the landgraviate of Cassel, M. Ledderhose
found two letters of Count Louis of Nassau to the landgrave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
William IV., one of which, dated March the 3rd, 1563,
is sealed with red wax, and the other, dated November 7th,
the same year, is sealed with black <span class="locked">wax<a name="FNanchor_375" id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">375</a></span>. M. Neuberger,
private keeper of the archives at Weimar, found among the
records of that duchy a letter sealed with red wax, and written
at Paris, May the 15th, 1571, by a French nobleman named
Vulcob, who the year before had been ambassador from the
king of France to the court of Weimar. It is worthy of remark,
that the same person had sealed nine letters of a prior
date with common wax, and that the tenth is sealed with
Spanish wax. P. L. Spiess, principal keeper of the records at
Plessenburg, who gave rise to this research by his queries, saw
a letter of the year 1574 sealed with red sealing-wax, and
another of the year 1620 sealed with black sealing-wax. He
found also in an old expense-book of 1616, that Spanish wax,
expressly, and other materials for writing were ordered from
a manufacturer of sealing-wax at Nuremberg, for the personal
use of Christian margrave of <span class="locked">Brandenburg<a name="FNanchor_376" id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">376</a></span>.</p>

<p>The oldest mention of sealing-wax which I have hitherto
observed in printed books is in the work of Garcia ab <span class="locked">Orto<a name="FNanchor_377" id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">377</a></span>,
where the author remarks, speaking of lac, that those sticks
used for sealing letters were made of it. This book was first
printed in 1563, about which time it appears that the use of
sealing-wax was very common among the Portuguese.</p>

<p>The oldest printed receipt for making sealing-wax was
found by Von Murr, in a work by Samuel Zimmerman, citizen
of Augsburg, printed in <span class="locked">1579<a name="FNanchor_378" id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">378</a></span>. The copy which I have from
the library of our university is signed at the end by the author
himself. His receipts for making red and green sealing-wax
I shall here transcribe.</p>

<p>“To make hard sealing-wax, called Spanish wax, with which
if letters be sealed they cannot be opened without breaking
the seal:&mdash;Take beautiful clear resin, the whitest you can procure,
and melt it over a slow coal fire. When it is properly
melted, take it from the fire, and for every pound of resin add
two ounces of vermilion pounded very fine, stirring it about.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
Then let the whole cool, or pour it into cold water. Thus you
will have beautiful red sealing-wax.</p>

<p>“If you are desirous of having black wax, add lamp-black
to it. With smalt or azure you may make it blue; with white-lead
white, and with orpiment yellow.</p>

<p>“If instead of resin you melt purified turpentine in a glass
vessel, and give it any colour you choose, you will have a
harder kind of sealing-wax, and not so brittle as the former.”</p>

<p>What appears to me worthy of remark in these receipts for
sealing-wax is, that there is no mention in them of shell-lac,
which at present is the principal ingredient, at least in that of
the best quality; and that Zimmerman’s sealing-wax approaches
very near to that which in diplomatics is called <i>maltha</i>. One
may also conclude therefore that this invention was not brought
from the East Indies.</p>

<p>The expression Spanish wax is of little more import than
the words Spanish-green, Spanish-flies, Spanish-grass, Spanish-reed,
and several others, as it was formerly customary to give
to all new things, particularly those which excited wonder, the
appellation of Spanish; and in the like manner many foreign
or new articles have been called Turkish; such as Turkish
wheat, Turkish paper, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Respecting the antiquity of wafers, M. Spiess has made an
<span class="locked">observation<a name="FNanchor_379" id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">379</a></span> which may lead to further researches, that the
oldest seal with a red wafer he has ever yet found, is on a letter
written by D. Krapf at Spires in the year 1624, to the
government at Bayreuth. M. Spiess has found also that some
years after, Forstenhäusser, the Brandenburg factor at Nuremberg,
sent such wafers to a bailiff at Osternohe. It appears
however that wafers were not used during the whole of the
seventeenth century in the chancery of Brandenburg, but
only by private persons, and by these even seldom; because,
as Spiess says, people were fonder of Spanish wax. The first
wafers with which the chancery of Bayreuth began to make
seals were, according to an expense account of the year 1705,
sent from Nuremberg. The use of wax however was still continued;
and among the Plassenburg archives there is a rescript
of 1722, sealed with proper wax. The use of wax must
have been continued longer in the duchy of Weimar; for in
the Electa Juris Publici there is an order of the year 1716, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
which the introduction of wafers in law matters is forbidden,
and the use of wax commanded. This order however was
abolished by duke Ernest Augustus in 1742, and wafers again
introduced.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="corn">CORN-MILLS.</h2>

<p>If under this name we comprehend all those machines, however
rude, employed for pounding or grinding corn, these are
of the highest antiquity. We read in the Scriptures, that
Abraham caused cakes to be baked for his guests of the finest
meal; and that the manna was ground like corn. The earliest
instrument used for this purpose seems to have been the mortar;
which was retained a long time even after the invention
of mills properly so called, because these perhaps at first were
not attended with much superior <span class="locked">advantage<a name="FNanchor_380" id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">380</a></span>. It appears
that in the course of time the mortar was made rigid and the
pestle notched, at least at the bottom; by which means the
grain was rather grated than pounded. A passage of <span class="locked">Pliny<a name="FNanchor_381" id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">381</a></span>,
not yet sufficiently cleared up, makes this conjecture probable.
When a handle was added to the top of the pestle, that it
might be more easily driven round in a circle, the mortar was
converted into a hand-mill. Such a mill was called <i>mola trusatilis</i>,
<i>versatilis</i>, <i>manuaria</i><a name="FNanchor_382" id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">382</a>, and was very little different from
those used at present by apothecaries, painters, potters and other
artists, for grinding coarse bodies, such as colours, glass, chalk,
&amp;c. We have reason to suppose that in every family there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
was a mill of this kind. Moses forbade them to be taken in
pawn; for that, says he, is the same thing as to take a man’s
life to pledge. Michaelis, on this passage, observes that a man
could not then grind, and consequently could not bake bread for
the daily use of his <span class="locked">family<a name="FNanchor_383" id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">383</a></span>. Grinding was at first the employment
of the women, and particularly of the female slaves, as it
is at present among uncivilised nations, and must therefore
have required little <span class="locked">strength<a name="FNanchor_384" id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">384</a></span>; but afterwards the mills were
driven by bondsmen, around whose necks was placed a circular
machine of wood, so that these poor wretches could not
put their hands to their mouths, or eat of the meal.</p>

<p>In the course of time shafts were added to the mill that it
might be driven by cattle, which were, as at present, <span class="locked">blindfolded<a name="FNanchor_385" id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">385</a></span>.
The first cattle-mills, <i>molæ jumentariæ</i>, had perhaps
only a heavy pestle like the <span class="locked">hand-mills<a name="FNanchor_386" id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">386</a></span>; but it must have
been soon remarked that the labour would be more speedily
accomplished if, instead of the pestle, a large heavy cylindrical
stone should be employed. I am of opinion, however, that
the first cattle-mills had not a spout or a trough as ours have
at present; at least the hand-mills which <span class="locked">Tournefort<a name="FNanchor_387" id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">387</a></span> saw at
Nicaria, and which consisted of two stones, had neither; but the
meal which issued from between the stones, through an opening
made in the upper one, fell upon a board or table, on which
the lower stone, that was two feet in diameter, rested.</p>

<p>The upper mill-stone was called <i>meta</i>, or <i>turbo</i>; and the
lower one <i>catillus</i>. <i>Meta</i> signified also a cone with a blunt
<span class="locked">apex<a name="FNanchor_388" id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">388</a></span>; and it has on that account been conjectured that corn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
was at first rubbed into meal by rolling over it a conical stone
flatted at the end, in the same manner as painters at present
make use of a grinding-stone; and it is believed that the same
name was afterwards given to the upper mill-stone. This
conjecture is not improbable, as some rude nations still bruise
their corn by grinding-stones. I do not, however, remember
any passage in the ancients that mentions this mode of grinding;
and I am of opinion, that the pestle of the hand-mill, for
which the upper mill-stone was substituted, may, on account
of its figure, have been also called <i>meta</i>. <span class="locked">Niebuhr<a name="FNanchor_389" id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">389</a></span> found
in Arabia, besides hand-mills, some grinding-stones, which
differed from those used by us in their consisting not of
a flat, but of an oblong hollow stone, or trough, with a pestle,
which was not conical, but shaped like a spindle, thick in
the middle and pointed at both ends. In this stone the corn,
after being soaked in water, was ground to meal and then
baked into cakes.</p>

<p>Respecting the figure and construction of the ancient hand-mills,
I expected to find some information from engraved stones,
and other remains of antiquity; but my researches would have
proved fruitless, had not Professor Diez, to whose memory and
erudition I am much indebted, pointed out to me the only
figure of one remaining. I say the only one remaining with
the more confidence, as Heyne tells us also that he remembers
no other. Anthony Francis <span class="locked">Gori<a name="FNanchor_390" id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">390</a></span> has described a red jasper,
on which is engraved the naked figure of a man, who in his
left-hand holds a sheaf of corn, and in his right a machine that
in all probability is a hand-mill. Gori considers the figure as
a representation of the god Eunostus, who, as Suidas says,
was the god of mills. The machine, which Eunostus seems
to exhibit, or to be surveying himself, is, as far as one can
distinguish (for the stone is scarcely half an inch in size),
shaped like a chest, narrow at the top, and wide at the bottom.
It stands upon a table, and in the bottom there is a perpendicular
pipe from which the meal, represented also by the artist,
appears to be issuing. Above, the chest or body of the mill
has either a top with an aperture, or perhaps a basket sunk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
into it, from which the corn falls into the mill. On one side,
nearly about the middle of it, there projects a broken shank,
which, without overstraining the imagination, may be considered
as a handle, or that part of the mill which some called
<i>molile</i>. Though this figure is small, and though it conveys
very little idea of the internal construction, one may, however,
conclude from it, that the roller, whether it was of wood or of
iron, smooth or notched, did not stand perpendicularly, like
those of our coffee-mills, but lay horizontally; which gives us
reason to conjecture a construction more ingenious than that
of the first invention. The axis of the handle had, perhaps,
within the body of the mill, a crown-wheel, that turned a
spindle, to the lower end of the perpendicular axis of which
the roller was fixed. Should this be admitted, it must be
allowed also, that the hand-mills of the ancients had not so
much a resemblance to the before-mentioned colour-mills as
to the philosophical mills of our chemists; and Langelott
consequently will not be the real inventor of the latter. On
the other side, opposite to that where the handle is, there arise
from the mill of Eunostus two shafts, which Gori considers
as those of a besom and a shovel, two instruments used in
grinding; but as the interior part cannot be seen, it appears
to me doubtful whether these may not be parts of the mill
itself.</p>

<p>The remains of a pair of old Roman mill-stones were found
in the beginning of the last century at Adel in Yorkshire, a
description of which was given by <span class="locked">Thornsby<a name="FNanchor_391" id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">391</a></span>, in the Philosophical
Transactions. One of the stones was twenty inches
in breadth; thicker in the middle than at the edges, and consequently
convex on one side. The other was of the same
form, but had that thickness at the edges which the other had
in the middle, and some traces of notching could be observed
upon it.</p>

<p>I shall not here collect all those passages of the ancients
which speak of hand- and cattle-mills, because they have been
already collected by others, and afford very little <span class="locked">information<a name="FNanchor_392" id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">392</a></span>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
Neither shall I inquire to what Ceres the Grecians ascribed
the invention of <span class="locked">mills<a name="FNanchor_393" id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">393</a></span>; who Milantes was, to whom that
honour has been given by Stephanus <span class="locked">Byzantinus<a name="FNanchor_394" id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">394</a></span>; or how
those mills were constructed which were first built by Myletes
the son of Lelex, king of <span class="locked">Laconia<a name="FNanchor_395" id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">395</a></span>. Such researches would
be attended with little advantage. I shall proceed therefore
to the invention of water-mills.</p>

<p>These appear to have been introduced in the time of Mithridates,
Julius Cæsar, and Cicero. Because <span class="locked">Strabo<a name="FNanchor_396" id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">396</a></span> relates
that there was a water-mill near the residence of Mithridates,
some have ascribed the honour of the invention to him; but
nothing more can with certainty be concluded from this circumstance,
than that water-mills were at that period known,
at least in Asia. We are told by Pomponius Sabinus, in his
remarks upon a poem of Virgil called Moretus, that the first
mill seen at Rome was erected on the Tiber, a little before the
time of Augustus; but of this he produces no proof. As he
has taken the greater part of his remarks from the illustrations
of Servius, and must have had a much completer copy of that
author than any that has been printed, he may have derived
this information from the same <span class="locked">source<a name="FNanchor_397" id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">397</a></span>. The most certain
proof that Rome had water-mills in the time of Augustus is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
the description which has been given of them by Vitruvius
(lib. x. 10). We learn from this passage, that the ancients
had wheels for raising water, which were driven by being trod
upon by men. That condemnation to these machines was a
punishment, appears from Artemidorus, lib. i. c. 50, and Sueton.
Vita Tiber. cap. 51. And the pretty epigram of Antipater;
“Cease your work, ye maids, ye who laboured in the mill;
sleep now, and let the birds sing to the ruddy morning; for
Ceres has commanded the water-nymphs to perform your task:
these, obedient to her call, throw themselves on the wheel,
force round the axle-tree, and by these means the heavy mill.”
This <span class="locked">Antipater<a name="FNanchor_398" id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">398</a></span>, as Salmasius with great probability asserts,
lived in the time of Cicero. <span class="locked">Palladius<a name="FNanchor_399" id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">399</a></span> also speaks with equal
clearness of water-mills, which he advises to be built on possessions
that have running water, in order to grind corn without
men or cattle.</p>

<p>There are also other passages of the ancients which are
commonly supposed, but without certain grounds, to allude
to water-mills. Among these is the following verse of <span class="locked">Lucretius<a name="FNanchor_400" id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">400</a></span>:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ut fluvios versare rotas atque haustra videmus.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>It appears also that the water-wheels to which Heliogabalus
caused some of his friends and parasites to be <span class="locked">bound<a name="FNanchor_401" id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">401</a></span>, cannot
be considered as mills. These, as well as the <i>haustra</i> of Lucretius,
were machines for raising water, like those mentioned
in the before-quoted passage of <span class="locked">Vitruvius<a name="FNanchor_402" id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">402</a></span>. It is however<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
evident that there were water-mills at Rome at this period;
and it affords matter of surprise that we do not find mention
oftener made of them, and that they did not entirely banish
the use of the laborious hand- and cattle-mills. That this was
not the case, and that the latter were very numerous for some
time after, may be concluded from various circumstances. When
Caligula, about twenty-three years after the death of Augustus,
took away all the horses and cattle from the mills, in order
to transport effects of every kind which he had seized, there
arose a scarcity of bread at Rome; from which Beroaldus
justly infers that water-mills must have been then very <span class="locked">rare<a name="FNanchor_403" id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">403</a></span>.
Nay, more than three hundred years after Augustus, cattle-mills
were so common at Rome, that their number amounted
to three <span class="locked">hundred<a name="FNanchor_404" id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">404</a></span>. Mention of them, and of the hand-mills
always occurs, therefore, for a long time after in the laws.
The Jurist Paulus, who lived about the year 240, particularizing
the bequest of a baker, mentions <i>asina molendaria</i> and
<i>mola</i>, a mill-ass and a <span class="locked">mill<a name="FNanchor_405" id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">405</a></span>. In the year 319 Constantine
ordered that all the slaves condemned to the mills should be
brought from Sardinia to <span class="locked">Rome<a name="FNanchor_406" id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">406</a></span>. Such orders respecting
mill-slaves occur also under <span class="locked">Valentinian<a name="FNanchor_407" id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">407</a></span>. When by the introduction
of Christianity, however, the morals of men became improved,
slaves were less frequent; and Ausonius, who lived
under Theodosius the Great, about the end of the third century,
expressly says, that in his time the practice had ceased of condemning
criminals to slavery, and of causing mills to be driven
by men.</p>

<p>Public water-mills, however, appear for the first time under
Honorius and Arcadius; and the oldest laws which mention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
them, about the year 398, show clearly that they were then a
new establishment, which it was necessary to secure by the
support of government; and the orders for that purpose were
renewed and made more severe by Zeno towards the end of
the fifth <span class="locked">century<a name="FNanchor_408" id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">408</a></span>. It is worthy of remark, that in the whole
code of Justinian one does not find the least mention of wooden
pales or posts, which occur in all the new laws; and which,
when there were several mills situated in a line on the same
stream, occasioned so many disputes. The mills at Rome were
erected on those canals which conveyed water to the city;
and because these were employed in several arts, and for various
purposes, it was ordered that by dividing the water the
mills should be always kept going. The greater part of them
lay under Mount <span class="locked">Janiculum<a name="FNanchor_409" id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">409</a></span>; but, as they were driven by so
small a quantity of water, they probably executed very little
work; and for this reason, but chiefly on account of the great
number of slaves, and the cheap rate at which they were maintained,
these noble machines were not so much used, nor were
so soon brought to perfection as they might have been. It
appears, however, that after the abolition of slavery they were
much improved and more employed; and to this a particular
incident seems in some measure to have contributed.</p>

<p>When Vitiges, king of the Goths, besieged Belisarius in
Rome, in the year 536, and caused the fourteen large expensive
aqueducts to be stopped, the city was subjected to great
distress; not through the want of water in general, because
it was secured against that inconvenience by the Tiber; but
by the loss of that water which the baths required, and, above
all, of that necessary to drive the mills, which were all situated
on these canals. Horses and cattle, which might have been
employed in grinding, were not to be found: but Belisarius
fell upon the ingenious contrivance of placing boats upon the
Tiber, on which he erected mills that were driven by the current.
This experiment was attended with complete success;
and as many mills of this kind as were necessary were constructed.
To destroy these, the besiegers threw into the stream
logs of wood and dead bodies, which floated down the river<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
into the city; but the besieged, by making use of booms, to
stop them, were enabled to drag them out before they could do
any <span class="locked">mischief<a name="FNanchor_410" id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">410</a></span>. This seems to be the invention of floating-mills,
at least I know of no other. It is certain that by these means
the use of water-mills became very much extended; for floating-mills
can be constructed almost upon any stream, without
forming an artificial fall; they can be stationed at the most
convenient places, and they rise and fall of themselves with
the water. They are however attended with these inconveniences,
that they require to be strongly secured; that they
often block up the stream too much, and move slowly; and
that they frequently stop when the water is too high, or when
it is frozen.</p>

<p>After this improvement the use of water-mills was never
laid aside or forgotten: they were soon made known all over
Europe; and were it worth the trouble, one might quote
passages in which they are mentioned in every century. The
Roman, Salic, and other <span class="locked">laws<a name="FNanchor_411" id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">411</a></span> provided security for these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
mills, which they call <i>molina</i> or <i>farinaria</i>; and define a
punishment for those who destroy the sluices, or steal the mill-irons
(<i>ferramentum</i>). But there were water-mills in Germany
and France a hundred years before the Salic laws were formed.
Ausonius, who lived about the year 379, mentions some which
were then still remaining on a small stream that falls into the
Moselle, and which were noticed also by <span class="locked">Fortunatus<a name="FNanchor_412" id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">412</a></span>, in the
fifth century. Gregory of Tours, who wrote towards the end
of the sixth century, speaks of a water-mill which was situated
near the town of Dijon; and of another which a certain abbot
caused to be built for the benefit of his <span class="locked">convent<a name="FNanchor_413" id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">413</a></span>. Brito, who
in the beginning of the thirteenth century wrote in verse an
account of the actions of Philip Augustus king of <span class="locked">France<a name="FNanchor_414" id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">414</a></span>,
relates how by the piercing of a dam the mills near Gournay
(<i>castrum Gornacum</i> or <i>Cornacum</i>) were destroyed, to the
great detriment of the besieged. In the first crusade, at the
end of the eleventh century, the Germans burned in Bulgaria
seven mills which were situated below a bridge on a small
rivulet, and which seem to have been <span class="locked">floating-mills<a name="FNanchor_415" id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">415</a></span>. In deeds
of the twelfth and thirteenth century, water-mills are often
called <i>aquimollia</i>, <i>aquimoli</i>, <i>aquismoli</i>, <i>aquimolæ</i><a name="FNanchor_416" id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">416</a>. Petrus
Damiani, one of the fathers of the eleventh century, says,
“Sicut aquimolum nequaquam potest sine gurgitis inundantia
frumenta permolere, ita, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_417" id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">417</a>”</p>

<p>At Venice and other places, there were mills which righted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
themselves by the ebbing and flowing of the tide, and which
every six hours changed the position of the wheels. <span class="locked">Zanetti<a name="FNanchor_418" id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">418</a></span>
has shown, from some old charters, that such mills existed
about the year 1044; and with still more certainty in 1078,
1079, and 1107. In one charter are the words: <i>Super toto
ipso aquimolo molendini posito in palude juxta campo alto</i>;
where the expression <i>aquimolum molendini</i> deserves to be
particularly remarked, as it perhaps indicates that the mill in
question was a proper grinding-mill. Should this conjecture
be well-founded, it would prove that so early as the eleventh
century water-mills were used not only for grinding corn, but
for many other purposes.</p>

<p>It appears that hand- and cattle-mills were everywhere still
retained at private houses a long time after the erection of
water-mills. We read in the Life of St. Benedict, that he
had a mill with an ass, to grind corn for himself and his colleagues.
Among the legendary tales of St. Bertin, there is
one of a woman who, because she ground corn on a fast-day,
lost the use of her arm; and of another whose hand stuck to
the handle, because she undertook the same work at an unseasonable
time. More wonders of this kind are to be found
at later periods in the Popish mythology. Such small mills remained
long in the convents; and it was considered as a great
merit in many ecclesiastics, that they ground their own corn
in order to make bread. The real cause of this was, that as
the convents were entirely independent of every person without
their walls, they wished to supply all their wants themselves
as far as possible; and as these lazy ecclesiastics had, besides,
too little labour and exercise, they employed grinding as an
amusement, and to enable them to digest better their ill-deserved
food. Sulpicius <span class="locked">Severus<a name="FNanchor_419" id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">419</a></span> gives an account of the mode
of living of an Eastern monk in the beginning of the fifth
century, and says expressly that he ground his own corn.
Gregory of Tours mentions an abbot who eased his monks of
their labour at the hand-mill, by erecting a water-mill. It
deserves here to be remarked, that in the sixth century malefactors
in France were condemned to the mill, as is proved by
the history of Septimina the nurse of <span class="locked">Childebert<a name="FNanchor_420" id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">420</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
The entrusting of that violent element water to support and
drive mills constructed with great art, displayed no little share
of boldness; but it was still more adventurous to employ the
no less violent but much more untractable, and always changeable
wind for the same purpose. Though the strength and
direction of the wind cannot be any way altered, it has however
been found possible to devise means by which a building
can be moved in such a manner that it shall be exposed to
neither more nor less wind than is necessary, let it come from
what quarter it may.</p>

<p>It is very improbable, or much rather false, that the Romans
had wind-mills, though Pomponius Sabinus affirms so, but
without any <span class="locked">proof<a name="FNanchor_421" id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">421</a></span>. <span class="locked">Vitruvius<a name="FNanchor_422" id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">422</a></span>, where he speaks of all moving
forces, mentions also the wind; but he does not say a word
of wind-mills; nor are they noticed either by <span class="locked">Seneca<a name="FNanchor_423" id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">423</a></span> or <span class="locked">Chrysostom<a name="FNanchor_424" id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">424</a></span>,
who have both spoken of the advantages of the wind.
I consider as false also, the account given by an old Bohemian
<span class="locked">annalist<a name="FNanchor_425" id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">425</a></span>, who says that before the year 718 there were none
but wind-mills in Bohemia, and that water-mills were then
introduced for the first time. I am of opinion that the author
meant to have written <i>hand- and cattle-mills</i> instead of <i>wind-mills</i>.</p>

<p>It has been often asserted that these mills were first invented
in the East, and introduced into Europe by the crusaders;
but this also is improbable; for mills of this kind are not at
all, or very seldom, found in the East. There are none of them
in Persia, Palestine, or Arabia, and even water-mills are there
uncommon, and constructed on a small scale. Besides, we
find wind-mills before the crusades, or at least at the time when
they were first undertaken. It is probable that these buildings
may have been made known to a great part of Europe, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
particularly in France and <span class="locked">England<a name="FNanchor_426" id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">426</a></span>, by those who returned
from these expeditions; but it does not thence follow that
they were invented in the <span class="locked">East<a name="FNanchor_427" id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">427</a></span>. The crusaders perhaps saw
such mills in the course of their travels through Europe; very
probably in Germany, which is the original country of most
large machines. In the like manner, the knowledge of several
useful things has been introduced into Germany by soldiers
who have returned from different wars; as the English and
French, after their return from the last war, made known in
their respective countries many of our useful implements of
husbandry, such as our straw-chopper, scythe, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Mabillon mentions a diploma of the year 1105, in which a
convent in France is allowed to erect water- and wind-mills,
<i>molendina ad ventum</i><a name="FNanchor_428" id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">428</a>. In the year 1143, there was in
Northamptonshire an abbey (Pipewell) situated in a wood,
which in the course of 180 years was entirely destroyed. One
cause of its destruction was said to be, that in the whole
neighbourhood there was no house, wind- or water-mill built,
for which timber was not taken from this <span class="locked">wood<a name="FNanchor_429" id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">429</a></span>. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
twelfth century, when these mills began to be more common,
a dispute arose whether the tithes of them belonged to the
clergy; and Pope Celestine III. determined the question in
favour of the <span class="locked">church<a name="FNanchor_430" id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">430</a></span>. In the year 1332, one Bartolomeo
Verde proposed to the Venetians to build a wind-mill. When
his plan had been examined, a piece of ground was assigned
to him, which he was to retain in case his undertaking should
succeed within a time <span class="locked">specified<a name="FNanchor_431" id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">431</a></span>. In the year 1393, the city
of Spires caused a wind-mill to be erected, and sent to the
Netherlands for a person acquainted with the method of grinding
by <span class="locked">it<a name="FNanchor_432" id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">432</a></span>. A wind-mill was also constructed at Frankfort
in 1442, but I do not know whether there had not been such
there before.</p>

<p>To turn the mill to the wind, two methods have been invented.
The whole building is constructed in such a manner
as to turn on a post below, or the roof alone, together with
the axle-tree, and the wings are moveable. Mills of the former
kind are called German-mills, those of the latter Dutch.
They are both moved round either by a wheel and pinion
within, or by a long lever <span class="locked">without<a name="FNanchor_433" id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">433</a></span>. I am inclined to believe
that the German-mills are older than the Dutch; for the
earliest descriptions which I can remember, speak only of the
former. <span class="locked">Cardan<a name="FNanchor_434" id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">434</a></span>, in whose time wind-mills were very common
both in France and Italy, makes however no mention of the
latter; and the Dutch themselves affirm, that the mode of
building with a moveable roof was first found out by a Fleming
in the middle of the sixteenth <span class="locked">century<a name="FNanchor_435" id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">435</a></span>. Those mills, by
which in Holland the water is drawn up and thrown off from
the land, one of which was built at Alkmaar in 1408, another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
at Schoonhoven in 1450, and a third at Enkhuisen in 1452,
were at first driven by horses, and afterwards by wind. But
as these mills were immoveable, and could work only when
the wind was in one quarter, they were afterwards placed not
on the ground, but on a float which could be moved round in
such a manner that the mill should catch every <span class="locked">wind<a name="FNanchor_436" id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">436</a></span>. This
method gave rise perhaps to the invention of moveable mills.</p>

<p>It is highly probable, that in the early ages men were satisfied
with only grinding their corn, and that in the course of
time they fell upon the invention of separating the meal from
the pollard or bran. This was at first done by a sieve moved
with the hands; and even yet in France, when what is called
<i>mouture en grosse</i> is employed, there is a particular place for
bolting, where the sieve is moved with the hand by means of
a handle. It is customary also in many parts of Lower Saxony
and Alsace, to bolt the flour separately; for which purpose
various sieves are necessary. The Romans had two principal
kinds, <i>cribra excussoria</i> and <i>pollinaria</i>, the latter of which
gave the finest flour, called <i>pollen</i>. Sieves of horse-hair were
first made by the Gauls, and those of linen by the <span class="locked">Spaniards<a name="FNanchor_437" id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">437</a></span>.
The method of applying a sieve in the form of an extended
bag to the works of the mill, that the meal might fall into it
as it came from the stones, and of causing it to be turned and
shaken by the machinery, was first made known in the beginning
of the sixteenth century, as we are expressly told in several
ancient <span class="locked">chronicles<a name="FNanchor_438" id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">438</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
This invention gave rise to an employment which at present
maintains a great many people; I mean that of preparing
bolting-cloths, or those kinds of cloth through which meal is
sifted in mills. As this cloth is universally used, a considerable
quantity of it is consumed. For one bolting-cloth, five
yards are required; we may allow, therefore, twenty-five to
each mill in the course of a year. When this is considered,
it will not appear improbable, that the electorate of Saxony,
according to a calculation made towards the end of the seventeenth
century, when manufactories of this cloth were established,
paid for it yearly to foreigners from twelve to fifteen
thousand rix-dollars. That kind of bolting-cloth also which
is used for a variety of needle-work, for young ladies’ samplers,
and for filling up the frames of window-screens, &amp;c., is
wove after the manner of gauze, of fine-spun woollen yarn.
One might imagine that this manufacture could not be attended
with any difficulty; yet it requires many ingenious
operations which the Germans cannot easily perform, and
with which they are, perhaps, not yet perfectly acquainted.
However this may be, large quantities of bolting-cloth are imported
from England. It indeed costs half as much again
per yard as the German cloth, but it lasts much longer. A
bolting-cloth of English manufacture will continue good three
months, but one of German will last scarcely three weeks.
The wool necessary for making this cloth must be long, well-washed,
and spun to a fine equal thread, which, before it is
scoured, must be scalded in hot water to prevent it from
shrinking. The web must be stiffened; and in this the English
have an advantage we have not yet been able to attain.
Their bolting-cloth is stiffer as well as smoother, and lets the
flour much better through it than ours, which is either very
little or not at all stiffened. The places where this cloth is
made are also not numerous. A manufactory of it was established
at Ostra, near Dresden, by Daniel Kraft, about the
end of the seventeenth century; and to raise him a capital
for carrying it on, every mill was obliged to pay him a dollar.
Hartau, near Zittau, is indebted for its manufactory to Daniel
Plessky, a linen-weaver of the latter, who learned the art of
making bolting-cloth in Hungary, when on a visit to his relations,
and was enabled to carry it on by the assistance of a
schoolmaster named Strietzel. Since that period this business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
has been continued there, and become <span class="locked">common<a name="FNanchor_439" id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">439</a></span>. The cloth
which is sent for sale, not only everywhere around the country,
but also to Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia, is wove in
pieces. Each piece contains from sixty-four to sixty-five
Leipsic ells: the narrowest is ten, and the widest fourteen
inches in breadth. A piece of the former costs at present
from four to about four dollars and a half, and one of the
latter six dollars. This cloth, it must be allowed, is not very
white; but it is not liable to spoil by lying in warehouses.
Large quantities of bolting-cloth are made also by a company
in the duchy of Wurtemberg. At what time this art was introduced
there I cannot say; for every thing I know of it I
am indebted to a friend, who collected for me the following
information in his return through that country. The cloth is
not wove in a manufactory, but by eighteen or twenty master
weavers, under the inspection of a company who pay them,
and who supply all the materials. The company alone has
the privilege of dealing in this cloth; and the millers must
purchase from their agents whatever quantity they have occasion
<span class="locked">for<a name="FNanchor_440" id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">440</a></span>. The millers however choose rather, if they can, to
supply themselves privately with foreign and other home-made
bolting-cloth, as they complain that the weavers engaged
by the company do not bestow sufficient care to render their
cloth durable: besides, the persons employed to carry about
this cloth for sale, often purchase secretly cloth of an inferior
quality in other places, and sell it as that of the company.
Bolting-cloth is made also at Gera, as well as at Potsdam and
Berlin; at the latter of which there is a manufactory of it
carried on by the Jews.</p>

<p>For some years past the French have so much extolled a
manner of grinding called <i>mouture économique</i>, that one might
almost consider it as a new invention, which ought to form an
epoch in the history of the miller’s art. This art, which however
is not new, consists in not grinding the flour so fine at
once as one may wish, and in putting the meal afterwards
several times through the mill, and sifting it through various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
sieves. This method, which in reality has nothing in it either
very ingenious or uncommon, was known to the ancient Romans,
as we may conclude from the account of Pliny, who
names the different kinds of meal, such as <i>similago</i>, <i>simila</i>,
<i>flos</i>, <i>pollen</i>, <i>cibarium</i>, &amp;c.; for these words are not synonymous,
but express clearly all the various kinds of meal or flour
which were procured from the same corn by repeated grinding
and sifting. In general, the Romans had advanced very
far in this <span class="locked">art<a name="FNanchor_441" id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">441</a></span>; and they knew how to prepare from corn
more kinds of meal, and from meal more kinds of bread, than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
the French have hitherto been able to obtain. Pliny reckons
that bread should be one-third heavier than the meal used for
baking it; and that this was the proportion in Germany above
a hundred years ago, is known from experiments on bread
made at different times, which, however uncertain they may
always have been, give undoubtedly more bread than <span class="locked">meal<a name="FNanchor_442" id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">442</a></span>.
In latter times the arts of grinding and of baking have declined
very much in Italy; and sensible Italians readily acknowledge
that their bread is much inferior to that of most
parts of Europe, and that in this respect the Germans are
their <span class="locked">masters<a name="FNanchor_443" id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">443</a></span>. Rome indeed forms an exception; for one
can procure there as good bread as in Germany; but it is
necessary to acquaint the reader, that it is not baked by Italians
but by Germans; and all the bread and biscuit baked at
Venice in the public ovens, either for home consumption, the
use of shipping, or for exportation, is the work of German
masters and journeymen. They are called to Venice expressly
for that purpose; and at Rome they form at present a company,
and have a very elegant church. The ovens of these
German bakers are seldom suffered to cool, and the greater
part of the owners of them become rich; but as through avarice
they often continue their labour, without interruption, in
the greatest heat for several days and nights, scarcely one in
ten of them lives to return with his wealth to Germany. The
Germans have, it is certain, long supplied the inhabitants of
proud Rome, the metropolis of Catholic Christendom, with
bread; for in the fifteenth century it was customary in all the
great families to use no other than German bread, as is very
circumstantially related by Felix Fabri, a Dominican monk,
who wrote about the end of the above century, and died in
<span class="locked">1502<a name="FNanchor_444" id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">444</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
The <i>mouture économique</i> has been long known in Germany.
Sebastian Muller, in the beginning of the seventeenth century,
gave so clear a description of it, that the French even
acknowledge <span class="locked">it<a name="FNanchor_445" id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">445</a></span>. This author says that one Butré, who came
to Germany to teach the Germans to grind and to bake, was
not a little disconcerted when he found his scholars more
expert than their officious master, and that he met with nothing
to console him but that, according to his opinion, the
mill-stones at Carlsruhe were too small, and that the bolting-sieves
were not made in the same manner as those at
<span class="locked">Paris<a name="FNanchor_446" id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">446</a></span>.</p>

<p>Millers and bakers, even in France, practised sometimes
this method of grinding so early as the sixteenth century; but
it was some time forbidden by the police as hurtful. In the
year 1546, those were threatened with punishment who should
grind their corn <span class="locked">twice<a name="FNanchor_447" id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">447</a></span>; and in 1658 this threat was renewed,
and the cause added, that such a practice was prejudicial to
the <span class="locked">health<a name="FNanchor_448" id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">448</a></span>. Such prohibitions however, made by the police
without sufficient grounds, could not prevent intelligent persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
from remarking that the bran still contained meal, which,
when separated from it, would be as proper for food as the
first. Those who had observed this were induced, by the probability
of advantage, to try to separate the remaining meal
from the bran; and the attempt was attended with success,
but it was necessary to keep it concealed. Malouin relates,
that above a hundred years before, a miller at Senlis employed
this method, and that the same practice was generally, though
privately, introduced at all the mills in the neighbourhood.
There were people who made a trade of purchasing bran in
order to separate it from the meal, which they sold; and it is
probable that many of them carried the art too far, and even
ground bran along with the meal. This was done chiefly
during times of scarcity, as in the year 1709. As men at
that time were attentive to every advantage, this art was more
known and more used, so that at length it became common.
The clergy of the royal chapel and parish church at Versailles
sent their wheat to be ground at an adjacent mill; it
was, according to custom, put through the mill only once,
and the bran, which still contained a considerable quantity of
meal, was sold for fattening cattle. In time, the miller, having
learned the <i>mouture économique</i>, purchased the bran from
these ecclesiastics, and found that it yielded him as good flour
as they procured from the whole wheat. The miller at length
discovered to them the secret, and gave them afterwards fourteen
bushels of flour from their wheat, instead of eight which
he had given them before. This voluntary discovery of the
miller was made in 1760, and it is probable that the art was
disclosed by more at the same time. A baker named Malisset
proposed to the lieutenant-général de police to teach a
method, by which people could grind their corn with more
advantage; and experiments were set on foot and published,
which proved the possibility of it. A mealman of Senlis,
named Buquet, who had the inspection of the mill belonging
to the large hospital at Paris, made the same proposal; the
result of his experiments, conducted under the direction of
magistrates, was printed; the investigation of this art was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
now taken up by men of learning, who gave it a suitable name;
and they explained it, made calculations on it, and recommended
it so much, that the <i>mouture économique</i> engaged the
attention of all the magistrates throughout <span class="locked">France<a name="FNanchor_449" id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">449</a></span>. Government
sent Buquet to Lyons in 1764, to Bordeaux in 1766, to
Dijon in 1767, and to Montdidier in 1768; and the benefit
which France at present derives from this improvement is
well worth that trouble. Before that period, a Paris <i>sétier</i>
yielded from eighty to ninety pounds of meal, and from one
hundred and fifty to one hundred and sixty pounds of bran;
but the same quantity yields now one hundred and eighty-five,
and according to the latest improvements one hundred
and ninety-five pounds of meal. In the time of St. Louis,
from four to five <i>sétiers</i> were reckoned necessary for the yearly
maintenance of a man, and these even were scarcely sufficient;
as many were allowed to the patients in the hospital
aux Quinze-Vingts; and such was the calculation made by
Budée in the sixteenth <span class="locked">century<a name="FNanchor_450" id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">450</a></span>. When the miller’s art was
everywhere improved, these four <i>sétiers</i> were reduced to three
and a half, and after the latest improvements to two.</p>

<p>Mills by which grain is only freed from the husk and
rounded, are called barley-mills, and belong to the new inventions.
At first barley was prepared only by pounding,
but afterwards by grinding; and as it was more perfectly
rounded by the latter method, it was distinguished from that
made by pounding by the name of pearl-barley. Barley-mills
differ very little in their construction from meal-mills;
and machinery for striking barley is generally added to the
latter. The principal difference is that the mill-stone is rough-hewn
around its circumference; and, instead of an under-stone,
has below it a wooden case, within which it revolves,
and which, in the inside, is lined with a plate of iron pierced
like a grater, with holes, the sharp edges of which turn upwards.
The barley is thrown upon the stone, which, as it
runs round, draws it in, frees it from the husk, and rounds it;
after which it is put into sieves and sifted. At Ulm, however,
the well-known Ulm barley is struck by a common mill, after
the stones have been separated a sufficient distance from each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
other. The first kind of barley-mills is a German invention.
In Holland the first was erected at Saardam not earlier than
the year 1660. This mill, which at first was called the Pellikaan,
scarcely produced in several years profit sufficient to
maintain a family; but in the beginning of the last century
there were at Saardam fifty barley-mills, which brought considerable
gain to their <span class="locked">proprietors<a name="FNanchor_451" id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">451</a></span>.</p>

<p>As long as the natural freedom of man continued unrestrained
by a multiplicity of laws, every person was at liberty
to build on his own lands and possessions whatever he thought
proper, and not only water- but also wind-mills. This freedom
was not abridged even by the Roman <span class="locked">law<a name="FNanchor_452" id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">452</a></span>. But as it is
the duty of rulers to consult what is best for the whole society
under their protection, princes took care that no one
should make such use of common streams as might impede or
destroy their public <span class="locked">utility<a name="FNanchor_453" id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">453</a></span>. On this account no individual
was permitted to construct a bridge over any stream; and it
is highly probable that the proprietors of land, when water-mills
began to be numerous, restrained, from the same principle,
the liberty of erecting them, and allowed them only, when
after a proper investigation they were declared to be not detrimental.
Water-mills, therefore, were included among what
were called <i>regalia</i>; and among these they are expressly
reckoned by the emperor Frederic <span class="locked">I.<a name="FNanchor_454" id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">454</a></span> On small streams
however which were not navigable, the proprietors of the
banks might build mills everywhere along <span class="locked">them<a name="FNanchor_455" id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">455</a></span>.</p>

<p>The avarice of landholders, favoured by the meanness and
injustice of governments, and by the weakness of the people,
extended this regality not only over all streams, but also
over the air and wind-mills. The oldest example of this with
which I am at present acquainted, is related by <span class="locked">Jargow<a name="FNanchor_456" id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">456</a></span>. In
the end of the fourteenth century, the monks of the celebrated
but long since destroyed monastery of Augustines, at Windsheim,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
in the province of Overyssel, were desirous of erecting
a wind-mill not far from Zwoll; but a neighbouring lord endeavoured
to prevent them, declaring that the wind in that
district belonged to him. The monks, unwilling to give up
their point, had recourse to the bishop of Utrecht, under
whose jurisdiction the province had continued since the tenth
century. The bishop, highly incensed against the pretender
who wished to usurp his authority, affirmed that no one had
power over the wind within his diocese but himself and the
church at Utrecht, and he immediately granted full power, by
letters patent, dated 1391, to the convent at Windsheim, to
build for themselves and their successors a good wind-mill, in
any place which they might find <span class="locked">convenient<a name="FNanchor_457" id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">457</a></span>. In the like
manner the city of Haerlem obtained leave from Albert count
palatine of the Rhine to build a wind-mill in the year <span class="locked">1394<a name="FNanchor_458" id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">458</a></span>.</p>

<p>Another restraint to which men in power subjected the
weak, in regard to mills, was, that vassals were obliged to
grind their corn at their lord’s mill, for which they paid a certain
value in kind. The oldest account of such ban-mills,
<i>molendina bannaria</i>, occurs in the eleventh century. Fulbert,
bishop of Chartres, and chancellor of France, in a letter
to Richard duke of Normandy, complains that attempts began
to be made to compel the inhabitants of a part of that
province to grind their corn at a mill situated at the distance
of five <span class="locked">leagues<a name="FNanchor_459" id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">459</a></span>. In the chronicle of the Benedictine monk
Hugo de Flavigny, who lived in the eleventh and twelfth century,
we find mention of <i>molendina quatuor cum banno ipsius
villæ</i><a name="FNanchor_460" id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">460</a>. More examples of this servitude, <i>secta ad molendinum</i>,
in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, may be seen in
Du Fresne, under the words <i>molendinum bannale</i>.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to account for the origin of these ban-mills.
When the people were once subjected to the yoke of slavery,
they were obliged to submit to more and severer servitudes,
which, as monuments of feudal tyranny, have continued even
to more enlightened times. De la <span class="locked">Mare<a name="FNanchor_461" id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">461</a></span> gives an instance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
where a lord, in affranchising his subjects, required of them,
in remembrance of their former subjection, and that he might
draw as much from them in future as possible, that they should
agree to pay a certain duty, and to send their corn to be ground
at his mill, their bread to be baked in his oven, and their
grapes to be pressed at his wine-press. But the origin of these
servitudes might perhaps be accounted for on juster grounds.
The building of mills was at all times expensive, and undertaken
only by the rich, who, to indemnify themselves for the
money expended in order to benefit the public, stipulated that
the people in the neighbourhood should grind their corn at no
other mills than those erected by them.</p>

pars Italiæ ruido utitur pilo; rotis etiam, quas aqua verset obiter, et molat.”
So reads Hardouin: but the French translator of Pliny divides these words
otherwise, and reads thus: “Major pars Italiæ ruido utitur pilo, rotis etiam
quas aqua verset; obiter et molit;” which he translates as follows; “Dans
la majeure partie de l’Italie, on se sert d’un pilon raboteux, ou de roues que
l’eau fait tourner; et par fois aussi on y emploie la meule.” This explanation
is in my opinion very proper; Pliny is not speaking here of the labour
of grinding corn, but that of freeing it from the husks, or of converting it
into grits. For this purpose a mortar was used, the pestle of which could
be so managed that the grain remained whole; but water-wheels were
sometimes employed also. I agree with Le Prince (Journal des Sçavans,
1779, Septem.), who thinks that Pliny here certainly speaks of a water-mill.</p></div>

by the enemy, as the mills were stopped for want of water, and as cattle
could not be found to drive them, the Romans, closely besieged, were
deprived of every kind of food (for with the utmost care they could scarcely
find provender for their horses). Belisarius however being a man of great
ingenuity devised a remedy for this distress. Below the bridge which
reaches to the walls of Janiculum, he extended ropes well-fastened, and
stretched across the river from both banks. To these he affixed two boats
of equal size, at the distance of two feet from each other, where the current
flowed with the greatest velocity under the arch of the bridge, and placing
large mill-stones in one of the boats, suspended in the middle space a
machine by which they were turned. He constructed at certain intervals
on the river, other machines of the like kind, which being put in motion
by the force of the water that ran below them, drove as many mills as were
necessary to grind provisions for the city,” &amp;c.</p></div>

the bolting machinery was removed, and this was attended with such good
consequences that each mill could grind as much as before. In Walser’s

<p class="fn3"><a name="Footnote_441" id="Footnote_441" href="#FNanchor_441" class="fnanchor">441</a>  One may easily perceive by what Pliny says, that the Romans had
made a variety of observations and experiments on grinding and baking.
By comparing his information with what we know at present, I have remarked
two things, which, as they will perhaps be serviceable to those who
hereafter may endeavour to illustrate Pliny, I shall lay before the reader.
That author says, book xviii. ch. 9, “Quæ sicca moluntur plus farinæ
reddunt; quæ salsa aqua sparsa, candidiorem medullam, verum plus retinent
in furfure.” A question here arises, whether the corn was moistened
before it was ground, and whether this was done with fresh or with salt
water. If Pliny, as is probable, here means a thorough soaking, he is not
mistaken; for it is certain that corn which has been exposed to much wet
yields less meal, and that the meal, which is rather gray or reddish than
white, will not keep long. The millers also are obliged, when corn has
been much wetted, to put it through the mill oftener, because it is more
difficult to be ground. It is true also, that when salt water is used for
moistening corn, the meal becomes clammier and more difficult to be separated
from the bran. It is well known that it is not proper to steep in salt
water, malt which is to be ground for beer. On the other hand, a moderate
soaking, which requires experience and attention, is useful, and is
employed in preparing the finest kinds of flour, such as the Frankfort,
Augsburg and Ulm speltmeal, which is exported to distant countries.
</p>
<p>
There is another passage in the tenth chapter of the same book of Pliny,
where he seems to recommend a thorough soaking of corn that is to be
ground. “De ipsa ratione pisendi Magonis proponetur sententia: triticum
ante perfundi aqua multa jubet, postea evalli, deinde sole siccatum
pilo repeti.” I am of opinion that we have here the oldest account of the
manner of making meal; that is, by pounding. This appears to me probable
from the words immediately preceding, which I have above endeavoured
to explain, and from the word <i>evalli</i>. I do not think that it ought
to be translated <i>to winnow</i>, as Salmasius says, in Exercitat. Plinianæ,
p. 907; but agree with Gesner in Thesaur. Steph., that it signifies to free the
corn from the husk. The corn was first separated from the husks by
pounding, which was more easily done after the grain had been soaked;
the shelled corn was then soaked again, and by these means rendered so
brittle that it was easily pounded to meal. The like method is employed
when people make grits without a mill, only by pounding; a process mentioned
by Krünitz in his Encyclopédie, vol. ix. p. 805.</p></div>

<h2 id="verdigris"><span class="smcap">VERDIGRIS, or SPANISH GREEN.</span></h2>

<p>Respecting the preparation of verdigris, various and in part
contradictory opinions have been entertained; and at present,
when it is with certainty known, it appears that the process is
almost the same as that employed in the time of Theophrastus,
Dioscorides, and <span class="locked">Vitruvius<a name="FNanchor_462" id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">462</a></span>. At that period, however,
every natural green copper salt was comprehended under the
name of <i>ærugo</i>. Dioscorides and Pliny say expressly, that a
substance of the nature of those stones which yielded copper
when melted, was scraped off in the mines of Cyprus; as is
still practised in Hungary, where the outer coat of the copper
ore is collected in the like manner, and afterwards purified by
being washed in water. Another species, according to the
account of Dioscorides, was procured from the water of a
grotto in the same island; and the most saleable natural verdigris
is still collected by a similar method in Hungary. The
clear water which runs from old copper-works is put into large
vessels, and after some time the green earth falls to the bottom
as a sediment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
The artificial <i>ærugo</i> of the ancients, however, was our verdigris,
or copper converted into a green salt by acetic acid.
To discover the method of procuring this substance could not
be difficult, as that metal contracts a green rust oftener than
is wished, when in the least exposed to acids. The ancients,
for this purpose, used either vessels and plates of copper, or
only shavings and filings; and the acid they employed was
either the sourest vinegar, or the sour remains left when they
made wine; such as grapes become sour, or the stalks and
skins after the juice had been pressed from <span class="locked">them<a name="FNanchor_463" id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">463</a></span>. Sometimes
the copper was only exposed to the vapour of vinegar
in close vessels, so that it did not come into immediate contact
with the acid; in the same manner as was practised with plates
of lead in the time of Theophrastus, when white-lead was
made, and as is still practised at present. Sometimes the metal
was entirely covered with vinegar, or frequently besprinkled
with it, and the green rust was from time to time scraped off;
and sometimes copper filings were pounded with vinegar in a
copper mortar, till they were changed into the wished-for
green salt. This article was frequently adulterated, sometimes
with stones, particularly pumice-stone reduced to powder, and
sometimes with copperas. The first deception was easily discovered;
and to detect the second, nothing was necessary but
to roast the verdigris, which betrayed the iron by becoming
red; or to add to the verdigris some gall-nut, the astringent
ingredients of which united with the oxide of iron of the
copperas, and formed a black ink.</p>

<p>In early periods verdigris was used principally for making
plasters, and for other medicinal purposes; but it was employed
also as a colour, and on that account it is by Vitruvius
reckoned among the pigments. When applied to the former
purpose, it appears that the copper salt was mixed with various
other salts and ingredients. One mixture of this kind was
called vermicular <span class="locked">verdigris<a name="FNanchor_464" id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">464</a></span>, the accounts of which in ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
authors seem to some commentators to be obscure; but in my
opinion we are to understand by them, that the ingredients
were pounded together till the paste they formed assumed the
appearance of pieces or threads like worms; and that from this
resemblance they obtained their name. For the same reason
the Italians give the name of <i>vermicelli</i> to wire-drawn paste of
flour used in <span class="locked">cookery<a name="FNanchor_465" id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">465</a></span>. When the process for making this kind
of verdigris did not succeed, the workmen frequently added
gum to it, by which the paste was rendered more viscous; but
this mixture is censured both by Pliny and Dioscorides. It
appears that the greater part of the verdigris in ancient times
was made in Cyprus, which was celebrated for its copper-works,
and in the island of Rhodes.</p>

<p>At present considerable quantities of verdigris are manufactured
at Montpelier in France, and by processes more advantageous
than those known to the <span class="locked">ancients<a name="FNanchor_466" id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">466</a></span>. The dried stalks
of grapes are steeped in strong wine, and with it brought to a
sour fermentation. When the fermentation has ceased, they
are put into an earthen pot, in alternate layers with plates of
copper, the surface of which in a few days is corroded by the
acetic acid, and the salt is then scraped off. It is certain,
that, even in the fifteenth century, the making of verdigris
was an old and profitable branch of commerce in France.
The city of Montpelier having been obliged to expend large
sums in erecting more extensive buildings to carry it on, and
having had very small profits for some years before, received
by letters patent from Charles VI., in 1411, permission to demand
sixteen sous for every hundred weight of verdigris made
there. In later times this trade has decayed very much.
Between the years 1748 and 1755, from nine to ten thousand
quintals were manufactured annually, by which the proprietors
had a clear profit of 50,000 crowns; but a sudden change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
seems to have taken place, for in 1759 the quantity manufactured
was estimated at only three thousand quintals. This
quantity required 630 quintals of copper, valued at 78,750
livres: the expenses of labour amounted to 1323 livres; the
necessary quantity of wine, 1033 measures, to 46,485 livres,
and extraordinaries to 10,330 livres; so that the three thousand
quintals cost the manufacturers about 136,888 livres. In the
year 1759, the pound of verdigris sold for nine sous six deniers:
so that the three thousand quintals produced 142,500
livres, which gave a net profit of only 5612 livres. Other
nations, who till that period had purchased at least three-fourths
of the French verdigris, made a variety of experiments in
order to discover a method of corroding copper which might
be cheaper; and some have so far succeeded that they can
supply themselves without the French paint in cases of <span class="locked">necessity<a name="FNanchor_467" id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">467</a></span>.</p>

<p>In commerce there is a kind of this substance known under
the name of distilled verdigris, which is nothing else than
verdigris purified, and crystallized by being again dissolved
in <span class="locked">vinegar<a name="FNanchor_468" id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">468</a></span>. For a considerable period this article was manufactured
solely by the Dutch, and affords an additional example
of the industry of that people. Formerly there was
only one person at Grenoble acquainted with this art, which
he kept secret and practised alone; but for some years past
manufactories of the same kind have been established in various
parts of Europe.</p>

<p>The German name of verdigris (<i>Spangrün</i>) has by most
authors been translated Spanish green; and it has thence been
concluded that we received that paint first from the Spaniards.
This word and the explanation of it are both old; for we find
<i>ærugo</i>, and <i>viride Hispanicum</i>, translated <i>Spangrün</i>, <i>Spongrün</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
or <i>Spansgrün</i>, in many of the earliest <span class="locked">dictionaries<a name="FNanchor_469" id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">469</a></span>,
such as that printed in <span class="locked">1480<a name="FNanchor_470" id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">470</a></span>. For this meaning, however,
I know no other proof than the above etymology, which carries
with it very little probability; and I do not remember
that I ever read in any other works that verdigris first came
from the Spaniards.</p>

<h2 id="saffron">SAFFRON.</h2>

<p>That the Latin word <i>crocus</i> signified the same plant which
we at present call saffron, and which, in botany, still retains
the ancient name, has, as far as I know, never been doubted;
and indeed I know no reason why it should, however mistrustful
I may be when natural objects are given out for those which
formerly had the like names. The moderns often apply ancient
names to things very different from those which were
known under them by the Greeks and the Romans: but what
we read in ancient authors concerning <i>crocus</i> agrees in every
respect with our saffron, and can scarcely be applied to any
other vegetable production. <i>Crocus</i> was a bulbous plant,
which grew wild in the mountains. There were two species
of it, one of which flowered in spring, and the other in autumn.
The flowers of the latter, which appeared earlier than
the green leaves that remained through the winter, contained
those small threads or <span class="locked">filaments<a name="FNanchor_471" id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">471</a></span> which were used as a medicine
and a paint, and employed also for seasoning various kinds
of <span class="locked">food<a name="FNanchor_472" id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">472</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
It appears that the medicinal use, as well as the name of this
plant, has always continued among the Orientals; and the
Europeans, who adopted the medicine of the Greeks, sent to
the Levant for <span class="locked">saffron<a name="FNanchor_473" id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">473</a></span>, until they learned the art of rearing
it themselves; and employed it very much until they were
made acquainted with the use of more beneficial articles, which
they substituted in its stead. Those who are desirous of knowing
the older opinions on the pharmaceutical preparation of
saffron, and the diseases in the curing of which it was employed,
may read Hertodt’s Crocologia, where the author has
collected all the receipts, and even the simplest, for preparing
<span class="locked">it<a name="FNanchor_474" id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">474</a></span>.</p>

<p>What in the ancient use of saffron is most discordant with
our taste at present, is the employing it as a perfume. Not
only were halls, theatres, and courts, through which one wished
to diffuse an agreeable smell, strewed with this <span class="locked">plant<a name="FNanchor_475" id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">475</a></span>, but it
entered into the composition of many spirituous extracts, which
retained the same scent; and these costly smelling waters were
often made to flow in small streams, which spread abroad their
much-admired <span class="locked">odour<a name="FNanchor_476" id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">476</a></span>. Luxurious people even moistened or
filled with them all those things with which they were desirous
of surprising their guests in an agreeable <span class="locked">manner<a name="FNanchor_477" id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">477</a></span>, or with
which they ornamented their apartments. From saffron, with
the addition of wax and other ingredients, the Greeks as well
as the Romans prepared also scented salves, which they used
in the same manner as our ancestors their <span class="locked">balsams<a name="FNanchor_478" id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">478</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
Notwithstanding the fondness which the ancients showed
for the smell of saffron, it does not appear that in modern
times it was ever much esteemed. As a perfume, it would
undoubtedly be as little relished at present as the greater part
of the dishes of Apicius, fricassees of sucking <span class="locked">puppies<a name="FNanchor_479" id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">479</a></span>, sausages,
and other parts of swine, which one could not even
mention with decency in genteel <span class="locked">company<a name="FNanchor_480" id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">480</a></span>; though it certainly
has the same scent which it had in the time of Ovid,
and although our organs of smelling are in nothing different
from those of the Greeks and the Romans. From parts of
the world to them unknown, we have, however, obtained perfumes
which far excel any with which they were acquainted.
We have new flowers, or, at least, more perfect kinds of flowers
long known, which, improved either by art or by accident, are
superior in smell to all those in the gardens of the Hesperides,
of Adonis and Alcinous, so much celebrated. We have learned
the art of mixing perfumes with oils and salts, in such a manner
as to render them more volatile, stronger, and more pleasant;
and we know how to obtain essences such as the ancient
voluptuaries never smelt, and for which they would undoubtedly
have given up their saffron. The smelling-bottles and
perfumes which are often presented to our beauties, certainly
far excel that promised by Catullus to a friend, with the assurance
that his mistress had received it from Venus and her
Cupids, and that when he smelt it he would wish to become
all nose:</p>

<p>It cannot, however, be denied that both taste and smell
depend very much on imagination. We know that many articles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
of food, as well as spices, are more valued on account of
their scarcity and costliness than they would otherwise be.
Hence things of less value, which approach near to them in
quality, are sought after by those who cannot afford to purchase
them; and thus a particular taste or smell becomes
fashionable. Brandy and tobacco were at first recommended
as medicines; they were therefore much used, and by continual
habit people at length found a pleasure in these potent
and almost nauseating articles of luxury. Substances which
gratify the smell become, nevertheless, like the colour of
clothes, oft unfashionable when they grow too common. Certain
spiceries, in which our ancestors delighted, are insupportable
to their descendants, whose nerves are weak, and more
delicate; and yet many of the present generation have accustomed
themselves to strong smells of various kinds, by gradually
using them more and more, till they have at length become
indispensable wants. Some have taken snuff rendered
so sharp by powdered glass, salts, antimony, sugar of lead,
and other poisonous drugs, that the olfactory nerves have been
rendered callous, and entirely destroyed by it.</p>

<p>That saffron was as much employed in seasoning dishes as
for a perfume, appears from the oldest work on cookery which
has been handed down to us, and which is ascribed to Apicius.
Its use in this respect has been long continued, and in many
countries is still more prevalent than physicians wish it to be.
Henry Stephen says, “Saffron must be put into all Lent soups,
sauces, and dishes: without saffron we cannot have well-cooked
<span class="locked">peas<a name="FNanchor_481" id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">481</a></span>.”</p>

<p>It may readily be supposed that the great use made of this
plant in cookery must have induced people to attempt to cultivate
it in Europe; and, in my opinion, it was first introduced
into Spain by the Arabs, as may be conjectured from its
name, which is Arabic, or rather <span class="locked">Persian<a name="FNanchor_482" id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">482</a></span>. From Spain it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>was, according to every appearance, carried afterwards to
France, perhaps to Albigeois, and thence dispersed into various
other <span class="locked">parts<a name="FNanchor_483" id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">483</a></span>. Some travellers also may, perhaps, have
brought bulbs of this plant from the Levant. We are at least
assured that a pilgrim brought from the Levant to England,
under the reign of Edward III., the first root of saffron, which
he had found means to conceal in his staff, made hollow for
that <span class="locked">purpose<a name="FNanchor_484" id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">484</a></span>. At what period this plant began to be cultivated
in Germany I do not know; but that this was first done
in Austria, in 1579, is certainly false. Some say that Stephen
von Hausen, a native of Nuremberg, who about that time
accompanied the imperial ambassador to Constantinople,
brought the first bulbs to Vienna, from the neighbourhood of
Belgrade. This opinion is founded on the account of Clusius,
who, however, does not speak of the autumnal saffron used as
a spice, but of an early sort, esteemed on account of the beauty
of its <span class="locked">flowers<a name="FNanchor_485" id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">485</a></span>. Clusius has collected more species of this
plant than any of his predecessors; and has given an account
by whom each of them was first made known.</p>

<p>In the fifteenth and following century, the cultivation of
saffron was so important an article in the European husbandry,
that it was omitted by no writer on that subject; and an
account of it is to be found in Crescentio, Serres, Heresbach,
Von Hohberg, Florinus, and others. In those periods,
when it was an important object of trade, it was adulterated
with various and in part noxious substances; and attempts
were made in several countries to prevent this imposition by
severe penalties. In the year 1550, Henry II., king of France,
issued an order for the express purpose of preventing such
frauds, the following extract from which will show some of the
methods employed to impose on the public in the sale of this
<span class="locked">article<a name="FNanchor_486" id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">486</a></span>: “For some time past,” says the order, “a certain
quantity of the said saffron has been found altered, disguised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
and sophisticated, by being mixed with oil, honey, and other
mixtures, in order that the said saffron, which is sold by weight,
may be rendered heavier; and some add to it other herbs,
similar in colour and substance to beef over-boiled, and reduced
to threads, which saffron, thus mixed and adulterated,
cannot be long kept, and is highly prejudicial to the human
body; which, besides the said injury, may prevent the above-said
foreign merchants from purchasing it, to the great diminution
of our revenues, and to the great detriment of foreign
nations, against which we ought to provide,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>[The high price demanded for saffron offers considerable
temptation to adulteration, and this is not uncommonly taken
advantage of. The stigmata of other plants, besides the true
saffron crocus (<i>Crocus sativus</i>), are frequently mixed with
those which are genuine; moreover, many other foreign substances
are added, such as the florets of the safflower (<i>Carthamus
tinctorius</i>), those of the marigold (<i>Calendula officinalis</i>),
slices of the flower of the pomegranate, saffron from which the
colouring has been previously extracted, and even fibres of
smoked beef. Most of these adulterations may be detected by
the action of boiling water, which softens and expands the
fibres, thus exposing their true shape and nature. The cake
saffron of commerce appears entirely composed of foreign
substances. Great medicinal virtues were formerly attributed
to saffron. Its principal use is now as a colouring matter.]</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="alum">ALUM.</h2>

<p>This substance affords a striking instance how readily one may
be deceived in giving names without proper examination. Our
alum was certainly not known to the Greeks or the Romans;
and what the latter called <i>alumen</i><a name="FNanchor_487" id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">487</a> was vitriol, (the green sulphate
of iron)<a name="FNanchor_488" id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">488</a>; not however pure, but such as forms in mines.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
To those who know how deficient the ancients were in the
knowledge of salts, and of mineralogy in general, this assertion
will without further proof appear highly <span class="locked">probable<a name="FNanchor_489" id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">489</a></span>. Alum and
green vitriol are saline substances which have some resemblance;
both contain the same acid called the vitriolic or sulphuric;
both have a strong astringent property, and on this
account are often comprehended under the common name of
styptic salts; and both are also not only found in the same
places, but are frequently obtained from the same minerals.
The difference, that the vitriols are combinations of sulphuric
acid with a metallic oxide, either that of iron, copper or zinc,
and alum on the other hand with a peculiar white earth, called
on this account alumina, has been established only in modern
<span class="locked">times<a name="FNanchor_490" id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">490</a></span>.</p>

<p>A stronger proof however in favour of my assertion, is what
follows:&mdash;The Greeks and the Romans speak of no other than
natural alum; but our alum is seldom produced spontaneously
in the earth, and several of our most accurate mineralogists,
such as Scopoli and Sage, deny the existence of native <span class="locked">alum<a name="FNanchor_491" id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">491</a></span>.
Crystals of real alum are formed very rarely on minerals which
abound in a great degree with aluminous particles, when they
have been exposed a sufficient time to the open air and the
rain; and even then they are so small and so much scattered,
that it requires an experienced and attentive observer to know
and discover them. The smallest trace of alum-works is not
to be found in the ancients, nor even of works for making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
vitriol (sulphate of iron), except what is mentioned by Pliny,
who tells us that blue vitriol was made in Spain by the process
of boiling; and this circumstance he considers as the only one
of its kind, and so singular, that he is of opinion no other salt
could be obtained in the same <span class="locked">manner<a name="FNanchor_492" id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">492</a></span>. Besides, everything
related by the ancients of their alum agrees perfectly with
native vitriols: but to describe them all might be difficult; for
they do not speak of pure salts, but of saline mixtures, which
nature of itself exhibits in various ways, and under a variety
of forms; and every small difference in the colour, the exterior
or interior conformation, however accidental, provided it could
be clearly distinguished, was to them sufficient to make a distinct
species, and to induce them to give it a new <span class="locked">name<a name="FNanchor_493" id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">493</a></span>.</p>

<p>The celebrity which the ancient alum had, as a substance
extremely useful in dyeing and medicine, was entirely forgotten
when the alum of the moderns became known; but this celebrity
was again revived when it was discovered that real alum
could be often made from minerals containing sulphur compounds;
or that where the latter are found there are generally
minerals which abound with it. In many of these places alum-works
have in the course of time been erected; and this
circumstance has served in some measure to strengthen the
opinion that the alum of the ancients and that of the moderns
are the same salt; because where the former was found in
ancient times, the latter has since been procured by a chemical
process. Some historians of the fifteenth century even speak
of the alum-works erected at that period, as if the art of making
this salt had only been revived in Europe.</p>

<p>The ancients procured their alum from various parts of the
world. Herodotus mentions Egyptian alum; for he tells us
that when the people of Delphos, after losing their temple by a
fire, were collecting a contribution in order to rebuild it, Amasis
king of Egypt sent them a thousand talents of <span class="locked">alum<a name="FNanchor_494" id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">494</a></span>. In
Pliny’s time the Egyptian alum was accounted the best. It
is well known that real alum is reckoned among the exports<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
of Egypt at present, but I am acquainted with no author who
mentions the place where it is found or made, or who has
described the method of preparing it.</p>

<p>The island of Melos, now called Milo, was particularly
celebrated on account of its alum, as we learn from Diodorus
Siculus, Celsus, Pliny and others, though none was to be found
there in the time of <span class="locked">Diodorus<a name="FNanchor_495" id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">495</a></span>. This native vitriol has been
observed in the grottos of that island by several modern
travellers, especially <span class="locked">Tournefort<a name="FNanchor_496" id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">496</a></span>, who very properly considers
it as the real alum of the ancients.</p>

<p>The islands of Lipara and Strongyle, or, as they are called
at present, Lipari and Stromboli, contained so great a quantity
of this substance, that the duty on it brought a considerable
revenue to the <span class="locked">Romans<a name="FNanchor_497" id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">497</a></span>. At one period, Lipari carried on
an exclusive trade in alum, and raised the price of it at pleasure;
but in that island at present there are neither vitriol nor
alum-works. Sardinia, Macedonia, and Spain, where alum
was found formerly, still produce a salt known under that
<span class="locked">name<a name="FNanchor_498" id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">498</a></span>.</p>

<p>When our alum became known, it was considered as a species
of the ancient; and as it was purer, and more proper to
be used on most occasions, the name of <span class="locked">alum<a name="FNanchor_499" id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">499</a></span> was soon appropriated
to it alone. The kinds of alum however known to the
ancients, which were green vitriol, maintained a preference in
medicine and for dyeing black; and on this account, these
impure substances have been still retained in druggists’ shops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
under the name of <i>misy</i>, <i>sory</i>, &amp;c. But a method was at
length found out of procuring thence crystallized martial salts
(salts of iron), which obtained the new name of <i>vitriol</i>. This
appellation had its rise first in the eleventh or twelfth century;
at least I know no writer older than Albertus Magnus by whom
it is mentioned or used. Agricola conjectures that it was
occasioned by the likeness which the crystals of vitriol had to
glass. This is also the opinion of <span class="locked">Vossius<a name="FNanchor_500" id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">500</a></span>; and it is very
singular that Pliny says nearly the same thing; for he observes,
speaking of blue vitriol, the only kind then known, that one
might almost take it for <span class="locked">glass<a name="FNanchor_501" id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">501</a></span>.</p>

<p>By inquiring into the uses to which the ancients applied
their alum, I find that it was sometimes employed to secure
wooden buildings against fire. This remark I have here introduced
to show that this idea, which in modern times has given
occasion to many expensive experiments, is not new. Aulus
<span class="locked">Gellius<a name="FNanchor_502" id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">502</a></span> relates, from the works of an historian now lost, that
Archelaus, one of the generals of Mithridates, washed over a
wooden tower with a solution of alum, and by these means
rendered it so much proof against fire, that all Sylla’s attempts
to set it in flames proved abortive. Many have conjectured
that the substance used for this purpose was neither vitriol nor
our alum, but rather asbestos, which is often confounded with
<span class="locked">Atlas-vitriol<a name="FNanchor_503" id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">503</a></span>; and against this mistake cautions are to be
found even in Theophrastus. But it may be asked, With
what was the asbestos laid on? By what means were the
threads, which are not soluble in water, made fast to the wood?
How could a tower be covered with it? I am rather inclined
to believe, that a strongly saturated solution of vitriol might
have in some measure served to prevent the effects of the fire,
at least as long as a thin coat of potters’ earth or flour-paste,
which in the present age have been thought deserving of experiments
attended with considerable expense. It does not
however appear that the invention of Archelaus, which is still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
retained in some old <span class="locked">books<a name="FNanchor_504" id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">504</a></span>, has been often put in <span class="locked">practice<a name="FNanchor_505" id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">505</a></span>;
for writers on the art of war, such, for example, as Æneas,
recommended vinegar to be washed over wood, in order to
prevent its being destroyed by fire.</p>

<p>I shall now proceed to the history of our present alum,
which was undoubtedly first made in the East. The period
of the invention I cannot exactly determine, but I conclude
with certainty that it is later than the twelfth <span class="locked">century<a name="FNanchor_506" id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">506</a></span>; for
John, the son of Serapion, who lived after Rhazes, was acquainted
with no other alum than the impure vitriol of <span class="locked">Dioscorides<a name="FNanchor_507" id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">507</a></span>.
What made the new alum first and principally
known was its beneficial use in the art of dyeing, in which it
is employed for fixing as well as rendering brighter and more
beautiful different colours. This art therefore the Europeans
learned from the Orientals, who, even yet, though we have
begun to apply chemistry to the improvement of dyeing, are in
some respects superior to us, as is proved by the red of Adrianople,
their silks and their Turkey leather. The Italians procured
their first alum from the Levant, along with other
materials for dyeing; but when these countries were taken
possession of by the Turks, it grieved the Christians to be
obliged to purchase these necessary articles from the common
enemy, and bitter complaints on that subject may be seen in
the works of various authors. In the course of time the Italians
became acquainted with the art of boiling alum; for
some of them had rented Turkish alum-works, and manufactured
that salt on their own account. They at length found
aluminous minerals in their own country, on which they made
experiments. These having answered their expectations, they
were soon brought into use; and this branch of trade declined
afterwards so much in Turkey, that many of the alum-works
there were abandoned.</p>

<p>We are told by many historians that the Europeans who
first made alum in Italy learned their art, as Augustin Justinian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
says, at Rocca di Soria, or Rocca in Syria. Neither in
books of geography nor in maps, however, can I find any place
of this name in Syria. I at first conjectured that Rocca on
the Euphrates might be here meant, but at present it appears
to me more probable that it is Edessa, which is sometimes
called Roha, Raha, Ruha, Orfa, and also Roccha, as has been
expressly remarked by <span class="locked">Niebuhr<a name="FNanchor_508" id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">508</a></span>. Edessa is indeed reckoned
to be in Mesopotamia, but some centuries ago Syria perhaps
was understood in a more extended sense. This much at least
is certain, that minerals which indicate alum have been often
observed by travellers in that neighbourhood.</p>

<p>It appears that the new alum was at first distinguished from
the ancient vitriol by the denomination of <i>Rocca</i>, from which
the French have made <i>alun de roche</i>, and some of the Germans
<i>rotzalaun</i><a name="FNanchor_509" id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">509</a>. Respecting the origin of this name very different
conjectures have been formed. Some think it is derived from
<i>rocca</i>, which in the Greek signifies a rock, because this salt is
by boiling procured from a stone; and these translate the
word <i>alumen rupeum</i>, from which the French name is <span class="locked">formed<a name="FNanchor_510" id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">510</a></span>.
Some are of opinion that alum obtained from alum-stone has
been so called to distinguish it from that procured from schists,
which is generally mixed with more iron than the <span class="locked">former<a name="FNanchor_511" id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">511</a></span>; and
others maintain that alum acquired the name of <i>Rocca</i> from
the alum-rocks in the neighbourhood of <span class="locked">Tolfa<a name="FNanchor_512" id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">512</a></span>. It is to be
remarked, on the other hand, that Biringoccio, that expert
Italian, confesses he does not know whence the name has
<span class="locked">arisen<a name="FNanchor_513" id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">513</a></span>. For my part I am inclined to adopt the opinion of
Leibnitz, that <i>alumen roccæ</i> was that kind first procured from
Rocca in Syria; and that this name was afterwards given to
every good species of alum, as we at present call the purest
Roman <span class="locked">alum<a name="FNanchor_514" id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">514</a></span>.</p>

<p>In the fifteenth century there were alum-works in the
neighbourhood of Constantinople, from which John di Castro,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
of whom I shall have occasion to speak hereafter, learned his
art. May not these alum-works be those visited by Bellon,
and of which he has given an excellent <span class="locked">description<a name="FNanchor_515" id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">515</a></span>? He
names the place <i>Cypsella</i> or <i>Chypsilar</i>, and says that the alum
in commerce is called <i>alumen Lesbium</i>, or <i>di Metelin</i>. The
alum procured from Constantinople at present may perhaps be
brought from the same spot; but I am not sufficiently acquainted
with its situation to determine that point with certainty,
for Büsching makes no mention of it. In some maps
I find the names <i>Ypsala</i> and <i>Chipsilar</i> on the western side of
the river Mariza, Maritz or Maricheh, which was the Hebrus
of the ancients; in others stands the name <i>Scapsiler</i> on the
west bank of the sea Bouron; and it is not improbable that
these may be all derived from the old <i>Scaptesyle</i> or <i>Scapta
Hyla</i>, where, according to the account of Theophrastus, Pliny
and others, there were considerable mines.</p>

<p>Another alum-work, no less celebrated in the fifteenth century,
was established near the city <i>Phocæa Nova</i>, at present
called <i>Foya Nova</i>, not far from the mouth of the Hermus, in
the neighbourhood of Smyrna. Of this work, Ducas, who had
a house there, has given a particular description, from which
we learn that in his time, that is under the reign of Michael
Palæologus, it was farmed by Italians, who sold the produce of
it to their countrymen, and to the Dutch, French, Spaniards,
English, Arabs, Egyptians, and people of Syria. This author
relates very minutely in what manner the alum was made, but
that work has been long since <span class="locked">abandoned<a name="FNanchor_516" id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">516</a></span>: alum however<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
made in the neighbourhood is still exported from <span class="locked">Smyrna<a name="FNanchor_517" id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">517</a></span>. It
is much to be wished that ingenious travellers would examine
the alum-works in Thrace, around Smyrna, and in Turkey in
general, and give an accurate description of them according
to the state in which they are at <span class="locked">present<a name="FNanchor_518" id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">518</a></span>.</p>

<p>The oldest alum-works in Europe were established about
the middle of the fifteenth century, but where they were first
erected cannot with certainty be ascertained; for it appears
that several were set on foot in different places at the same
period. Some affirm that the first alum made in Europe was
manufactured in the island Ænaria, or Pithacusa, at present
called Ischia, by a Genoese merchant, whom some name
Bartholomew Perdix, and others Pernix. This man, who is
praised on account of his ingenuity and attachment to the
study of natural history, having often travelled through Syria,
learned the method of boiling alum at Rocca; and on his return
found alum-stones among the substances thrown up by the
eruption of a volcano which had destroyed part of the island,
and gave occasion to their being first employed in making that
salt. Such is the account of respectable historians, <span class="locked">Pontanus<a name="FNanchor_519" id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">519</a></span>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
<span class="locked">Bizaro<a name="FNanchor_520" id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">520</a></span>, Augustine <span class="locked">Justinian<a name="FNanchor_521" id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">521</a></span>, and <span class="locked">Bottone<a name="FNanchor_522" id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">522</a></span>, who wrote much
later. Bizaro says that this happened in the year 1459, which
agrees perfectly with the account of Pontanus; for he tells us
that it was under the reign of Ferdinand I., natural son of
Alphonsus, who ascended the throne in 1458. Besides, the
earthquake, which had laid waste the island one hundred and
sixty-three years before, took place in 1301, which makes the
time of this invention to fall about the year 1464. So seems
Bottone also to have reckoned, for he mentions expressly the
year 1465.</p>

<p>The alum-work which is situated about an Italian mile northwest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
from Tolfa, and six from Civita Vecchia, in the territories
of the Church, is by some Italian historians reckoned to have
been the first. However this may be, it is certain that it is
the oldest carried on at present. The founder of it was John
di Castro, a son of the celebrated lawyer, Paul di <span class="locked">Castro<a name="FNanchor_523" id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">523</a></span>,
who had an opportunity at Constantinople, where he traded in
Italian cloths and sold dye-stuffs, of making himself acquainted
with the method of boiling alum. He was there at the time
when the city fell into the hands of the Turks; and after this
unfortunate event, by which he lost all his property, he returned
to his own country. Pursuing there his researches
in natural history, he found in the neighbourhood of Tolfa a
plant which he had observed growing in great abundance in
the aluminous districts of Asia: from this he conjectured that
the earth of his native soil might also contain the same salt;
and he was confirmed in that opinion by its astringent taste.
At this time he held an important office in the Apostolic
Chamber; and this discovery, which seemed to promise the
greatest advantages, was considered as a real victory gained
over the Turks, from whom the Italians had hitherto been
obliged to purchase all their alum. Pope Pius II., who was
too good a financier to neglect such a beneficial discovery,
caused experiments to be first made at Viterbo, by some
Genoese who had formerly been employed in the alum-works
in the Levant, and the success of them was equal to his expectations.
The alum, which was afterwards manufactured in
large quantities, was sold to the Venetians, the Florentines,
and the Genoese. The Pope himself has left us a very minute
history of this discovery, and of the circumstances which gave
rise to <span class="locked">it<a name="FNanchor_524" id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">524</a></span>. Some pretend that Castro was several years a slave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
to a Turk who traded in <span class="locked">alum<a name="FNanchor_525" id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">525</a></span>; others affirm that he had
even been obliged to labour as a slave in <span class="locked">alum-works<a name="FNanchor_526" id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">526</a></span>; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
others, that he learned the art of boiling alum from a citizen
of Corneto, a town in the dominions of the Pope, and from a
Genoese, both of whom had acquired their knowledge in the
<span class="locked">Levant<a name="FNanchor_527" id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">527</a></span>. But as I do not wish to ascribe a falsehood to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
Pontiff, I am of opinion that the history of this discovery must
have been best known to him. He has not, indeed, established
the year with sufficient correctness; but we may conclude
from his relation that it must have been 1460 or 1465. The
former is the year given by Felician Bussi; and the latter that
given in the history of the city of Civita Vecchia.</p>

<p>The plant which first induced John di Castro to search for
alum was that evergreen, prickly shrub, the <i>Ilex aquifolium</i>,
or holly, which in Italy is still considered as an indication
that the regions where it grows abound with that salt. But
though it is undoubtedly certain that the quality of the soil
may be often discovered by the wild plants which it produces,
it is also true that this shrub is frequently found where there
is not the smallest trace of alum; and that it is not to be seen
where the soil abounds with it, as has been already remarked
by <span class="locked">Boccone<a name="FNanchor_528" id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">528</a></span> and <span class="locked">Tozzetti<a name="FNanchor_529" id="FNanchor_529" href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">529</a></span>.</p>

<p>Among the earliest alum-works may be reckoned that which
was erected at Volterra, in the district of Pisa, in 1458, by a
Genoese named <span class="locked">Antonius<a name="FNanchor_530" id="FNanchor_530" href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">530</a></span>. Others say that it was constructed
by an architect of Sienna; but this opinion has perhaps
arisen only from the work having been farmed by a citizen of
Sienna, or built at his expense. On account of this alum-work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
an insurrection of the inhabitants of Volterra broke out in
1472; but it was at length quelled by the Florentines, who
took and plundered the <span class="locked">city<a name="FNanchor_531" id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">531</a></span>. Brutus, who wrote his History
of Florence in the year 1572, says that this alum-work was
carried on in his time: but this is certainly false; for Raphael
di <span class="locked">Volterra<a name="FNanchor_532" id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">532</a></span>, who died in 1521 in his native city, expressly
tells us that in his time alum was no longer boiled there; and
this is confirmed by <span class="locked">Baccius<a name="FNanchor_533" id="FNanchor_533" href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">533</a></span>, who also lived in the sixteenth
century. At present no remains of it are left; so that Tozzetti
was not able to discover the place where the alum-stones
were <span class="locked">broken<a name="FNanchor_534" id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">534</a></span>.</p>

<p>It appears from what has been said, that the art of boiling
alum in Europe was first known in Italy, but not before the
year 1548. That document therefore of the year 1284, quoted
by Tozzetti, and in which alum-works, <i>alumifodinæ</i>, are mentioned,
must, as he himself thinks, be undoubtedly <span class="locked">false<a name="FNanchor_535" id="FNanchor_535" href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">535</a></span>.</p>

<p>The great revenue which the Apostolical Chamber derived
from alum, induced many to search for aluminous minerals,
and works were erected wherever they were found. Several
manufactories of this substance were established therefore in
various parts, which are mentioned by <span class="locked">Baccius<a name="FNanchor_536" id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">536</a></span>, Biringoccio,
and other writers of the sixteenth century. The pope however
understood his own interest so well, that he never rested
until he had caused all the works erected in the territories of
others to be given up, and until he alone remained master of
the prize. He then endeavoured by every method possible to
prevent foreigners from acquiring an accurate knowledge of
the art of boiling alum; and at the same time found means,
by entering into commercial treaties with other nations, and
by employing the medium of religion, which has always the
greatest effect on weak minds, to extend his commerce in this
article more and more. The price was raised from time to
time, and it at length became so high that foreigners could
purchase this salt at a cheaper rate from the Spaniards, and
even when they sent for it to Turkey. His Holiness, that he
might convert this freedom of trade into a sin, and prevent it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
by the terror of excommunication, artfully gave out that he
meant to set apart the income arising from his alum-works to
the defence of Christianity; that is, towards carrying on war
against the Turks. Prohibitions and threats now followed in
case any one should be so unchristian as to purchase alum
from the Infidels; but every person was at liberty to make
what bargain he could with his Holiness for this commodity.</p>

<p>In the year 1468 Pope Paul II. entered into a commercial
treaty respecting alum with Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy;
but in 1504 Roman alum had risen to such an exorbitant
price, that Philip the Fair, archduke of Austria, caused
a council of inquiry to be held at Bruges, by which it appeared
that this article could be purchased at a much cheaper
rate in Turkey. Commissions therefore were sent thither for
that purpose; but scarcely was this known at Rome, when a
prohibition, under pain of excommunication, was issued by
Pope Julius II. This pontiff however was not the only one
from whom such prohibitions proceeded: bulls of the like
kind were issued also by Julius III., Paul III., Paul IV., Gregory
XIII. and <span class="locked">others<a name="FNanchor_537" id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">537</a></span>.</p>

<p>But these means, like all those founded on the simplicity of
others, could not be of long duration; and as soon as men became
a little more enlightened, they learned to know their
own interest, and to discover the selfishness of the Pope’s bulls.
Unless Biringoccio, who visited a part of the German mines, be
under a mistake, the first European alum-work out of Italy
was erected in Spain; and is that still carried on with considerable
profit at Almacaron, not far from <span class="locked">Carthagena<a name="FNanchor_538" id="FNanchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">538</a></span>. In
the beginning of the sixteenth century very large quantities of
alum were brought to Antwerp, as we learn from Guicciardini’s
Description of the Netherlands.</p>

<p>At what time the first alum-work was erected in Germany,
I am not able to determine; but it appears that alum began
to be made at Oberkaufungen in Hesse in the year 1554. For
the alum-work at Commotau in Bohemia, the first letters-patent
were granted in 1558. An alum-work was established
at Lower Langenau in the county of Glatz in 1563; but it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
was soon after abandoned. Several other manufactories of
alum are mentioned by Agricola, such as that of Dieben or
Duben, in the circle of Leipsic, and those of Dippoldiswalda,
Lobenstein, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In England the first alum-work was erected at Gisborough
in Yorkshire, in the reign of queen Elizabeth; though <span class="locked">Anderson<a name="FNanchor_539" id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">539</a></span>
says in 1608. Sir Thomas Chaloner, who had an estate
there, conjecturing from the nature of the plants which grew
wild that there must be minerals in the neighbourhood, after
making some search, at length discovered alum. As there
was however no one in England at that time who understood
the method of preparing it, he privately engaged workmen belonging
to the Pope’s alum-works; and it is said, that as soon
as the Pontiff heard this, he endeavoured to recall them by
threats and anathemas. These however did no injury to the
heretics; and in a little time the alum-work succeeded so
well, that several more of the same kind were soon after
<span class="locked">established<a name="FNanchor_540" id="FNanchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">540</a></span>. But what more dishonoured the Pontiff’s denunciations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
was, that in later times the proprietors of the
English alum-works farmed those of the Apostolic Chamber,
and increased in various ways the benefit derived from
<span class="locked">them<a name="FNanchor_541" id="FNanchor_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">541</a></span>.</p>

<p>At what period alum-works were established in other
countries I have not been able to learn. I however know that
one was erected at <span class="locked">Andrarum<a name="FNanchor_542" id="FNanchor_542" href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">542</a></span> in Sweden in 1630.</p>

<p>[The process for obtaining alum from the alum-stone of
Tolfa, which is also found in Hungary, Auvergne, and other
parts of the world, and which contains <i>all</i> the ingredients requisite
for the production of alum, has been fully described.
The greater portion however of the alum manufactured in
this country is obtained from alum-slate,&mdash;a bituminous schist
containing iron-pyrites (sulphuret of iron) diffused in extremely
fine particles throughout its mass. Many of these
schists crumble to pieces when they are exposed to the air;
the sulphur of the pyrites becomes gradually converted by the
absorption of oxygen from the atmosphere into sulphuric acid,
while, at the same time, the iron is peroxidized, and having in
this state no very great affinity for the sulphuric acid, parts
with the greater portion of it to the clay, which is thus converted
into sulphate of alumina. Many of these schists are of
such a loose texture, and contain the pyrites in so fine a state
of division, that the requisite heat is generated by the rapidity
with which the several chemical changes proceed; others,
from their compactness and deficiency in combustible matter,
require calcining by a slow smothered fire. When the calcination
is complete, the mass is lixiviated, the solutions are run
into cisterns for evaporation, and when they have attained a
certain strength, are precipitated with sulphate or muriate of
potash or ammonia. The precipitated alum is washed, drained,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
and separated from various impurities by re-solution and crytallization,
and is then fit for the market.</p>

<p>A very interesting process has recently been patented by
Dr. Turner of <span class="locked">Gateshead<a name="FNanchor_543" id="FNanchor_543" href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">543</a></span>. It consists in fusing felspar, which
is a silicate of potash and alumina, with more potash. On
treating the fused mass with water, it is separated into two
parts; the first, a solution containing silicate of potash, from
which the potash may be obtained by passing through it a
stream of carbonic acid gas, or by filtering it through a bed
of caustic lime; the second, an insoluble residue, consisting
of a silicate of alumina and potash. On digesting this with
sulphuric acid, the silica is separated and a solution of alum
obtained.]</p>

aluminous mineral. The stones found on the top of this mountain are first
calcined in the fire, and then reduced to powder by being thrown into
water. The water mixed with that powder is put into a kettle; and a
little more water being added to it, and the whole having been made to
boil, the powder is lixiviated, and the thick part which falls to the bottom
in a cake is preserved; what is hard and earthy is thrown away as of no
use. The cake is afterwards suffered to dissolve in vessels for four days;
at the end of which the alum is found in crystals around their edges, and
the bottoms of them also are covered with pieces and fragments of the like
nature. The remaining liquor, which at the end of four days does not
harden, is poured into a kettle, more water and more powder are added to
it, and being boiled as before, it is put into proper vessels, and the alum
obtained in this manner is preserved as an article very necessary for dyers.
All masters of ships bound from the Levant to Europe, consider alum as a
very convenient and useful lading for vessels.... In the reign of Michael
Palæologus, the first emperor of his family, some Italians requested a lease
of that mountain, for which they promised to pay a certain sum annually....
The Romans and the Latins built Phocæa Nova on the sea-shore,
at the bottom of that mountain which lies on the east side of it. On the
west it has the island of Lesbos, on the north the neighbouring bay of
Elæa, and on the south it looks towards the Ionian sea.”&mdash;Ducæ Historia

situation of the island, and of the nature of its soil. That Ænaria has been
at some time violently separated from the continent by an earthquake,
seems proved by a variety of circumstances, such as calcined rocks; the
ground full of caverns; and the earth, which, like that of the main land,
being abundant in warm springs, and dry, feeds internal fire, and on that
account contains a great deal of alum. A few years ago Bartholomew
Perdix, a Genoese merchant passing this island in his way to Naples, observed
some aluminous rocks scattered here and there along the sea-coast.
About a hundred and sixty-three years before that period, the earth having
suddenly burst by the effects of fire confined in its bowels, a considerable
part of Ænaria was involved in flames. By this eruption a small town was
burned and afterwards swallowed up; and large masses of rock mixed with
flames, sand and smoke, thrown up where the shore looks towards Cumæ,
fell upon the neighbouring fields, and destroyed the most fruitful and the
most pleasant part of the island. Some of these huge pieces of rock being
at that time still lying on the shore, Bartholomew, by calcining them in a
furnace, extracted alum from them, and revived that art which he had
brought from Rocca in Syria, where he had traded for several years, and
which had been neglected in Italy for many centuries.”&mdash;Pontani Hist.

purpose of commerce, returned to his native country. Soon after, he made
a voyage to the island of Ænaria, situated in the Tuscan sea, called formerly
Pythacusa, and now in the vulgar Greek Iscla or Ischia; and being a man
of an acute genius, and a diligent investigator of natural objects, he observed
near the sea-coast several rocks fit for making alum. He took some
fragments of them therefore, and having calcined them in a furnace, he
procured from them most excellent alum. He was the first person who,
to the incredible benefit of many, brought as it were again into use that
art long abandoned and almost lost in Italy and the greater part of other
countries. On that account his name deserves to be rescued from oblivion.”&mdash;Genuensis

<p class="fn3"><a name="Footnote_524" id="Footnote_524" href="#FNanchor_524" class="fnanchor">524</a>  “A little before that period came to Rome John di Castro, with whom
the Pontiff had been acquainted when he carried on trade at Basle, and
was banker to Pope Eugenius. His father, Paul, was a celebrated lawyer
of his time, who sat many years in the chair at Padua, and filled all Italy
with his decisions; for law-suits were frequently referred to him, and judges
paid great respect to his authority, as he was a man of integrity and sound
learning. At his death he left considerable riches, and two sons arrived to
the age of manhood, the elder of whom, following the profession of the
father, acquired a very extensive knowledge of law. The other, who was a
man of genius, and who applied more to study, made himself acquainted
with grammar and history: but, being fond of travelling, he resided some
time at Constantinople, and acquired much wealth by dyeing cloth made
in Italy, which was transported thither and committed to his care, on
account of the abundance of alum in that neighbourhood. Having by these
means an opportunity of seeing daily the manner in which alum was made,
and from what stones or earth it was extracted, he soon learned the art.
When, by the will of God, that city was taken and plundered about the year
1453, by Mahomet II., emperor of the Turks, he lost his whole property;
but, happy to have escaped the fire and sword of these cruel people, he returned
to Italy, after the assumption of Pius II., to whom he was related,
and from whom he obtained, as an indemnification for his losses, the office
of commissary-general over all the revenues of the Apostolic Chamber, both
within and without the city. While, in this situation, he was traversing all
the hills and mountains, searching the bowels of the earth, leaving no stone
or clod unexplored, he at length found some alum-stone in the neighbourhood
of Tolfa. Old Tolfa is a town belonging to two brothers, subjects of
the Church of Rome, and situated at a small distance from Civita Vecchia.
Here there are high mountains, retiring inland from the sea, which abound
with wood and water. While Castro was examining these, he observed
that the grass had a new appearance. Being struck with wonder, and inquiring
into the cause, he found that the mountains of Asia, which enrich
the Turkish treasury by their alum, were covered with grass of the like
kind. Perceiving several white stones, which seemed to be minerals, he bit
some of them, and found that they had a saltish taste. This induced him to
make some experiments by calcining them, and he at length obtained alum.
He repaired therefore to the Pontiff, and addressing him said, ‘I announce
to you a victory over the Turk. He draws yearly from the Christians above
three hundred thousand pieces of gold, paid to him for the alum with which
we dye wool different colours, because none is found here but a little at the
island of Hiscla, formerly called Ænaria, near Puteoli, and in the cave of
Vulcan at Lipari, which, being formerly exhausted by the Romans, is now
almost destitute of that substance. I have however found seven hills, so
abundant in it, that they would be almost sufficient to supply seven worlds.
If you will send for workmen, and cause furnaces to be constructed, and
the stones to be calcined, you may furnish alum to all Europe; and that
gain which the Turk used to acquire by this article, being thrown into your
hands, will be to him a double loss. Wood and water are both plenty,
and you have in the neighbourhood the port of Civita Vecchia, where
vessels bound to the West may be loaded. You can now make war against
the Turk: this mineral will supply you with the sinews of war, that is
money, and at the same time deprive the Turk of them.’ These words
of Castro appeared to the Pontiff the ravings of a madman: he considered
them as mere dreams, like the predictions of astrologers; and all the cardinals
were of the same opinion. Castro, however, though his proposals
were often rejected, did not abandon his project, but applied to his Holiness
by various persons, in order that experiments might be made in his presence,
on the stones which he had discovered. The Pontiff employed skilful
people, who proved that they really contained alum; but lest some deception
might have been practised, others were sent to the place where they
had been found, who met with abundance of the like kind. Artists who
had been employed in the Turkish mines in Asia were brought from Genoa;
and these, having closely examined the nature of the place, declared it to
be similar to that of the Asiatic mountains which produce alum; and,
shedding tears for joy, they kneeled down three times, worshiping God,
and praising his kindness in conferring so valuable a gift on our age. The
stones were calcined, and produced alum more beautiful than that of Asia,
and superior in quality. Some of it was sent to Venice and to Florence,
and, being tried, was found to answer beyond expectation. The Genoese
first purchased a quantity of it, to the amount of twenty thousand pieces of
gold; and Cosmo of Medici for this article laid out afterwards seventy-five
thousand. On account of this service, Pius thought Castro worthy of the
highest honours and of a statue, which was erected to him in his own
country, with this inscription: ‘To John di Castro, the inventor of alum;’
and he received besides a certain share of the profit. Immunities and a
share also of the gain were granted to the two brothers, lords of Tolfa, in
whose land the aluminous mineral had been found. This accession of
wealth to the Church of Rome was made, by the divine blessing, under the
pontificate of Pius II.; and if it escape, as it ought, the hands of tyrants,
and be prudently managed, it may increase and afford no small assistance
to the Roman Pontiffs in supporting the burdens of the Christian religion.”&mdash;Pii

When they possessed in Maremma di Roma, Tolfa, Castello, and a jurisdiction

a vassal of these lords, who had been many years a slave in Turkey to an
alum-merchant, returned free to his own country; and observing that in
the territories of Tolfa there was abundance of alum mineral, he gave notice
of it to Lodovico Frangipani, his lord, and was the cause of greatly increasing
his revenues. Pope Paul II., however, pretending that the mineral belonged
to the Apostolic See, as supreme lord of the fief, and not being
able to persuade Lodovico to give it up to the Church, he declared war
against him, but was vigorously opposed by Lodovico and his brother Peter,
lords of Tolfa, assisted by the Orsini their relations; so that the Pope was

experiments were made on them at Viterbo in the following manner. The
stones were first calcined in a furnace; a large quantity of water was then
thrown over them; and when they were entirely dissolved, the water was
boiled in great leaden caldrons; after which it was poured into wooden
vessels, where, evaporating by degrees, the result was alum of the most
perfect kind. Pope Pius II., sensible of the great benefit which might arise
from this mineral to the Apostolic Chamber, employed more than eight

<p class="fn3"><a name="Footnote_540" id="Footnote_540" href="#FNanchor_540" class="fnanchor">540</a>  Such is the account of Pennant in his Tour in Scotland, 1768. “The
alum-works in this country are of some antiquity; they were first discovered
by sir Thomas Chaloner in the reign of queen Elizabeth, who observing
the trees tinged with an unusual colour, made him suspicious of
its being owing to some mineral in the neighbourhood. He found out that
the strata abounded with an aluminous salt. At that time the English
being strangers to the method of managing it, there is a tradition that sir
Thomas was obliged to seduce some workmen from the Pope’s alum-works
near Rome, then the greatest in Europe. If one may judge from the curse
which his Holiness thundered out against sir Thomas and his fugitives, he
certainly was not a little enraged; for he cursed by the very form that
Ernulphus has left us, and not varied a tittle from that most comprehensive
of imprecations. The first pits were near Gisborough, the seat of the Chaloners,
who still flourish there notwithstanding his Holiness’s anathema.”
The following passage, extracted from Camden’s Britannia, is much to the
same purpose: “This (alum) was first discovered a few years since (anno
1607) by the admirable sagacity of that learned naturalist sir Thomas
Chaloner, knt. (to whose tuition his majesty (king James the First) committed
the delight and glory of Britain, his son prince Henry), by observing
that the leaves of trees were of a more weak sort of green here than in

<h2 id="falconry">FALCONRY.</h2>

<p>The question whether Falconry was known to the ancient
Greeks, has been determined in the negative by Flavius <span class="locked">Blondus<a name="FNanchor_544" id="FNanchor_544" href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">544</a></span>,
Laurentius <span class="locked">Valla<a name="FNanchor_545" id="FNanchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">545</a></span>, both writers of the fifteenth century;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
and likewise by <span class="locked">Rigallius<a name="FNanchor_546" id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">546</a></span>, Pancirollus, Salmuth, and many
others. It may, nevertheless, be here asked, what is generally
understood under that term? However much the thousand
barks which carried the Grecians to the siege of Troy might
have been inferior to those floating castles lately seen by my
countrymen before Gibraltar, they were nevertheless ships;
and we cannot, on that account, deny that the Greeks were
acquainted with the art of ship-building, though it was evidently
then in its infancy. In the like manner I agree with
<span class="locked">Giraldus<a name="FNanchor_547" id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">547</a></span>, in allowing that they had some knowledge of falconry.
I do not believe that they knew the art of hawking,
that is, of chasing game with birds of prey previously trained,
as practised in modern times, and which serves more for the
amusement of trifling princes than for any useful purpose; but
that they had begun to employ the rapacity of some of the
winged tribe in hunting and fowling, cannot, in my opinion,
be <span class="locked">denied<a name="FNanchor_548" id="FNanchor_548" href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">548</a></span>.</p>

<p>So early as the time of Ctesias, hares and foxes were hunted
in India by means of rapacious <span class="locked">birds<a name="FNanchor_549" id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">549</a></span>. The account of Aristotle
however is still more to the purpose, and more worthy
of <span class="locked">notice<a name="FNanchor_550" id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">550</a></span>. “In Thrace,” says he, “the men go out to catch
birds with <span class="locked">hawks<a name="FNanchor_551" id="FNanchor_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">551</a></span>. The men beat the reeds and bushes which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
grow in marshy places, in order to raise the small birds, which
the hawks pursue and drive to the ground, where the fowler
kills them with poles.” A similar account is to be found in
another book ascribed also to Aristotle, which appears, at any
rate, to be the work of an author not much younger, but with
two additions, which render the circumstance still more <span class="locked">remarkable<a name="FNanchor_552" id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">552</a></span>.
The first is, that the falcons appeared when
called by their names; and the second, that of their own accord
they brought to the fowlers whatever they caught themselves.
Nothing is here wanting but the spaniel employed to
find out game, the hood which is put upon the head of the
hawk while it is perched on the hand, and the thong used for
holding it, to form a short description of falconry as still practised.
Our falconers, when they have taken the bird from
the hawk, give him, in return, a small share of it; and in the
like manner the Thracian hawks received some part of their
booty. Other writers after Aristotle, such as <span class="locked">Antigonus<a name="FNanchor_553" id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">553</a></span>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
Ælian<a name="FNanchor_554" id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">554</a>, <span class="locked">Pliny<a name="FNanchor_555" id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">555</a></span>, and <span class="locked">Phile<a name="FNanchor_556" id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">556</a></span>, have also given an account of
this method of fowling. Ælian, who seldom relates anything
without some alteration or addition, says that in Thrace nets
were used, into which the birds were driven by the hawks;
and in this he is followed by the poet Phile. Ælian, also, in
another place describes a manner of hunting with hawks in
India, which, as we are told by several travellers, is still practised
in Persia, where it is well understood, and by other
eastern <span class="locked">nations<a name="FNanchor_557" id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">557</a></span>.</p>

<p>It seems, therefore, that the Greeks received from India
and Thrace the first information respecting the method of
fowling with birds of prey; but it does not appear that this
practice was introduced among them at a very early period.
In Italy, however, it must have been very common, for Martial
and Apuleius speak of it as a thing everywhere known.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
The former calls a hawk a fowler’s servant, and the latter
makes use of a kind of pun on the word <i>accipiter</i>, which signified
also a species of <span class="locked">fish<a name="FNanchor_558" id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">558</a></span>. It cannot indeed be said that
this art was ever forgotten; but, like other inventions, though
at first much admired, it was afterwards neglected, so that it
remained a long time without improvement. It is however
certain that it was at length brought to the utmost degree of
perfection. It is mentioned in the Roman <span class="locked">laws<a name="FNanchor_559" id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">559</a></span>, and in writers
of the fourth and fifth centuries.</p>

<p>Julius Firmicus Maternus, who in the time of Constantine
the Great, about the year 336, wrote his Astronomicon, in
which he teaches the art of casting nativities, assures us that
those who are born under certain signs will become great
sportsmen, and keep hounds and <span class="locked">falcons<a name="FNanchor_560" id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">560</a></span>. Caius Sollius
Apollinaris Sidonius, who lived about the year 480, celebrates
Herdicius, his wife’s brother, and son of the emperor Avitus,
because he first practised in his territories hunting and fowling
with dogs and hawks. The same author mentions hawking
also in other parts of his work. That this diversion, however,
has not been oftener spoken of and praised, needs excite little
wonder. Hunting, and all the concomitant arts, were at first
employed for use; in the course of time they were practised
by servants, and easy means only of catching game were
sought for. But when luxury was introduced into states, and
the number of those who lived by other people’s labour increased,
these idlers began to employ that time which they
had not learned to make a proper use of, or which they were
not compelled to apply to more valuable purposes, in catching
wild animals by every method that ingenuity could suggest,
or in tormenting them by lingering deaths. Hunting
and fowling, therefore, received many improvements by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
assistance of art; and the indolent clergy even indulged in
these cruel sports, though often forbidden by the church.
Such prohibitions were issued by the council of Agda in the
year 506; by that of Epaon in 517; by that of Macon in 585,
and perhaps oftener, but never with much effect.</p>

<p>Before I proceed further, I shall make two remarks. First,
that Pietro Crescentio gives one Daucus as the inventor of the
art of taming hawks, but without proof, or even probability.
Secondly, that the ancients bred up to hunting and fishing several
rapacious animals which at present are not used for that
purpose, such as the <span class="locked">seal<a name="FNanchor_561" id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">561</a></span> and <span class="locked">sea-wolf<a name="FNanchor_562" id="FNanchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">562</a></span>. <span class="locked">Astruc<a name="FNanchor_563" id="FNanchor_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">563</a></span> has endeavoured
to confute this idea; but his reasoning appears to me
to have little weight; and I agree in opinion with Rondeletius
and Isaac <span class="locked">Vossius<a name="FNanchor_564" id="FNanchor_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">564</a></span>, that seals might be instructed to catch
fish; I myself have seen some, that, when commanded by their
master, exhibited a variety of movements and tricks which undoubtedly
prove their aptness to learn.</p>

<p>The art of falconry seems to have been carried to the greatest
perfection, and to have been much in vogue at the principal
courts of Europe in the twelfth century. Some on that
account have ascribed the invention of it to the emperor Frederic
I., and others to Frederic II. Frederic I., called Barbarossa,
was the first who brought falcons to Italy; at least
Pandolfo <span class="locked">Collenuccio<a name="FNanchor_565" id="FNanchor_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">565</a></span> says that this was the common report,
and <span class="locked">Radevicus<a name="FNanchor_566" id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">566</a></span> seems to confirm it; but I do not know from
what authority Pancirollus tells us that that emperor invented
falconry at the time when he was besieging Rome. Rainaldo,
marquis of Este, was the first among the Italian princes who
used this method of <span class="locked">fowling<a name="FNanchor_567" id="FNanchor_567" href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">567</a></span>; and that the emperor Henry
followed the example of his father, seems proved by the words
of Collenuccio. The service rendered by Frederic II. to this
art, if it can be said to deserve service, is shown by the book
which he wrote in Latin on it, entitled De Arte Venandi cum
Avibus, and which was printed for the first time at Augsburg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
in the year 1596, from a manuscript belonging to Joachim Camerarius,
a physician of Nuremberg. It has here and there
deficiencies, because the manuscript was torn, and some additions
by the author’s son Manfred, king of Sicily. In the
second book, there is an account of the use and manner of
making hoods, called <i>capellæ</i>, which we are there told were
invented by the Arabs. The emperor received as a present
some hooded falcons from Arabian princes, and procured people
from Arabia who understood the management of <span class="locked">them<a name="FNanchor_568" id="FNanchor_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">568</a></span>.
Albertus Magnus has inserted a great deal from the work of
this emperor in his book upon animals.</p>

<p>In none of the sports of the field have the fair sex partaken
so much as in falconry. The ladies formerly kept hawks, in
which they greatly delighted, and which were as much fondled
by those who wished to gain their favour as lap-dogs are at
<span class="locked">present<a name="FNanchor_569" id="FNanchor_569" href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">569</a></span>. What tended principally, however, to bring it into
disuse, was the invention of gunpowder. After that, hawks
were discarded, and the whole enjoyment of fowling was confined
to shooting. Less skill and labour were indeed required
in this new exercise; but the ladies abandoned the pleasures
of the chase, because they disapproved of the use of fire-arms,
which were attended both with alarm and danger.</p>

<p>Among the oldest writers on falconry, we may reckon Demetrius,
who about the year 1270 was physician to the emperor
Michael Palæologus. His book, written in Greek, was first
printed at Paris in 1612, by Nicholas Rigaltius, from a manuscript<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
in the king’s library, and with the Latin translation of
Peter <span class="locked">Gyllius<a name="FNanchor_570" id="FNanchor_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">570</a></span>. Some other works on the same subject, the
antiquity of which is unknown, were printed at the same time.
One in the Catalonian dialect has the forged title of Epistola
Aquilæ, Symmachi et Theodotionis ad Ptolemæum regem
Ægypti de re accipitraria. All these writings treat chiefly on
the rearing and diseases of hawks; and contain cures, which,
though some of them perhaps may be good enough, would not
undoubtedly be all approved by any person of skill at <span class="locked">present<a name="FNanchor_571" id="FNanchor_571" href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">571</a></span>.
Aloes, to the size of about a bean, are ordered as a purge;
and quicksilver is prescribed for the itch and outbreaking.
We are told also, that a wild and untractable falcon was confined
some time with a hood on in a smith’s shop, where it was
soon tamed by the continual thumping of the hammers. One
precept in Demetrius respecting the art of falconry seems
very ill-suited to the practice of modern times. He desires
sportsmen to say their prayers before they go out to the field.
Had this custom been continued to the present day, many great
men would be like the people mentioned by a certain traveller,
who solicit the assistance of God when they are preparing for
a piratical <span class="locked">expedition<a name="FNanchor_572" id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">572</a></span>; but with this difference, that these
rovers plunder only strange ships, whereas the latter destroy
the property and possessions of their own subjects.</p>

<p class="fn3"><a name="Footnote_544" id="Footnote_544" href="#FNanchor_544" class="fnanchor">544</a>  This author, Blondus or Biondo, describing an Italian village, says, “I
shall embrace this opportunity of mentioning a new circumstance, which
is, that fowling with that rapacious bird the falcon, a diversion much followed
at Arno, by the celebrated Alphonsus king of Arragon, was entirely
unknown about two hundred years ago; for though Servius, the grammarian,
says that Capua received that name from the augury of a falcon, because
the Hetruscans, when founding it, saw one of these birds, which in
their language was called <i>capis</i>; yet he does not tell us of what use they
were to mankind. Besides, Pliny, who gives the names of many rapacious
birds of the hawk kind (‘accipitres scilicet majores et minores achilvones,
quos aliqui falcones fuisse volunt’), says nothing of their being employed to
catch game; and, without doubt, had fowling in this manner been practised
in the time of Virgil, he would have made Æneas and Dido carry such birds
along with them when they went out a hunting, whereas he says only,

I will venture therefore to affirm, that two hundred years ago, as I have
already said, no nation or people were accustomed to catch either land- or
water-fowls with any rapacious bird tamed for that purpose.” I shall
here observe, that Biondo must have had a faulty copy of Pliny; for the
word <i>achilvones</i> is not to be found in that author, who, nevertheless, mentions
the practice of fowling with birds of prey.</p></div>

into the marshes in quest of birds, accompanied by falcons. The men beat

pursuing game <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">ἱέρακες</span>; and Pliny calls them <i>accipitres</i>. It would be
difficult, perhaps impossible, to distinguish with sufficient accuracy all the
species of these birds to which the ancients gave different names. This
genus is numerous, and the species often differ so little from each other,
that it is not easy to establish their characterizing marks. Besides, they
for the most part change their colour, and often their whole appearance,
according to their age or the season of the year; so that these characters
become very uncertain. It appears that on this account the ancients often
divided one species into two or more, and imagined that many species
passed one into the other, or that new species were produced by the mixture
of different breeds. It seems however certain that the ancients divided
those birds of prey which fly abroad in the day-time, into three species:
<span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">ἀετὸς</span> aquila; <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">γὺπς</span> vultur; and <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">ἱέραξ</span> accipiter. The first and last
belong to that genus which Linnæus calls <i>falco</i>, and are the large species
of it. The vultures are the Ger-falcons, which are sufficiently distinguished

for their purpose, they call the hawks by their names, which immediately
appear as soon as they hear their voices, and chase the birds into
the bushes, where the boys knock them down with sticks and seize them.
What is still more wonderful, when these hawks lay hold of any birds,
they throw them to the fowlers; but the boys, in return, give them some

from Arabia and every other country such as were most skilful in it;
and I received from them the best information they were able to give.
Because the use of the hood was one of the most effectual methods they
knew for taming hawks, and as I saw the great benefit of it, I employed a
hood in training these birds; and it has been so much approved in Europe,
that it is proper it should be handed down to posterity.”</p></div>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="turf">TURF.</h2>

<p>The discovery, that many kinds of earth, when dried, might
be employed as fuel, may have easily been occasioned by an
accident in some place destitute of wood. A spark falling
fortuitously on a turf-moor during a dry summer often sets it
on fire, and the conflagration it occasions generally lasts so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
long that it cannot escape <span class="locked">notice<a name="FNanchor_573" id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">573</a></span>. Of the earth taking fire
in this manner there are many instances to be found in the
ancients. One of the most remarkable is that mentioned by
Tacitus, who relates, that not long after the building of the
city of Cologne, the neighbouring land took fire, and burned
with such violence that the corn, villages, and every production
of the fields were destroyed by the flames, which advanced
even to the walls of the <span class="locked">city<a name="FNanchor_574" id="FNanchor_574" href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">574</a></span>. This remarkable passage
is not to be understood as alluding to a volcanic eruption,
but to a morass which had been set on fire. In the duchy of
Berg and around Cologne there are very extensive morasses,
from which turf is dug up for fuel, and which undoubtedly
serve to confirm this idea.</p>

<p>That the use of turf was well known in the earliest periods
in the greater part of Lower Saxony, and throughout the
Netherlands, is fully proved by Pliny’s account of the Chauci,
who inhabited that part of Germany which at present comprehends
the duchies of Bremen and Verden, the counties of
Oldenburg, Delmenhorst, Diepholz, Huy and East Friesland.
Pliny says expressly, that the Chauci pressed together with
their hands a kind of peat earth, which they dried by the
wind rather than by the sun, and which they used not only
for cooking their victuals, but also for warming their <span class="locked">bodies<a name="FNanchor_575" id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">575</a></span>.
I explain also by turf a short passage of Antigonus Carystius,
quoted from Phanias, in which it is said that a morass in Thessaly
having become dry, took fire and burned.</p>

<p>The account therefore given in some Dutch chronicles, that
turf and the manner of preparing it were first found out about
the year 1215, and that about 1222 it had become common,
is certainly <span class="locked">false<a name="FNanchor_576" id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">576</a></span>. This information may be applicable to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
certain lands and districts, and correct as to the introduction
of this kind of fuel in those parts; for the use of it was not
extended far till a late period; and even yet turf is neither
employed nor known in many places which possess it, even
though they are destitute of <span class="locked">wood<a name="FNanchor_577" id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">577</a></span>. Some improvement in
the manner of preparing turf may have also been considered
as the invention of this fuel, which is undoubtedly of greater
antiquity. What induced Monconys to ascribe the invention
of turf to Erasmus, or who first propagated that error, I can
as little conjecture as <span class="locked">Misson<a name="FNanchor_578" id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">578</a></span>.</p>

<p>Scaliger has <span class="locked">erred<a name="FNanchor_579" id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">579</a></span> no less than Monconys, whose account
was doubted by <span class="locked">Uffenbach<a name="FNanchor_580" id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">580</a></span>. According to the first-mentioned
author, turf had been used in the Netherlands only about three
hundred years before his time, and he adds that he did not
know that this kind of fuel had ever been mentioned by the
ancients.</p>

<p>Those however are mistaken also who believe that it is to
be found in the Salic laws and those of the Alemanni. It is
true that the word <i>turpha</i> occurs in the former, and that Wendelin
and others have declared it to mean turf; but the assertion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
of Eccard, that it signifies a village, called in German
<i>Dorf</i><a name="FNanchor_581" id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">581</a>, is more probable. Still less can the doubtful word
<i>curfodi</i>, in the laws of the Alemanni, be supposed to allude to
this substance, though we are assured by Lindenbrog that he
found in a manuscript, in its stead, the term <i>zurb</i><a name="FNanchor_582" id="FNanchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">582</a>. It is also
not credible that turf should be employed at that period, as
wood was everywhere superabundant.</p>

<p>The oldest certain account of turf in the middle ages with
which I am at present acquainted, is that pointed out by
<span class="locked">Trotz<a name="FNanchor_583" id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">583</a></span>, who says that it occurs in a letter of donation of the
year 1113. He has given the words in the Dutch language,
as if they had stood so in the original. But he has quoted his
authority in so careless a manner, that I have not been able to
conjecture what kind of book he meant. I have however
found a Latin copy of the letter of donation in a work pointed
out to me by Professor <span class="locked">Reuss<a name="FNanchor_584" id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">584</a></span>. An abbot Ludolph, in the
year 1113, permitted a nunnery near Utrecht to dig <i>cespites</i>
for its own use in a part of his <i>venæ</i>, but at the same time he
retained the property of these <i>venæ</i>. Now there can be no
doubt that <i>vena</i> signifies a turf bog, and <i>cespites</i> turf. The
former is the same word as <i>Fenne</i> or <i>Venne</i>, which occurs in
the old Frisic and the present <i>Veen</i><a name="FNanchor_585" id="FNanchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">585</a> of the Dutch. The nuns
also could make no other use of the turf but employ it as fuel.
This passage however proves nothing; though Trotz says that
a great trade was carried on with turf in the twelfth century,
and that the abbot wished to interdict the nuns from using
it.</p>

<p>It is worthy of remark that the words <i>turba</i>, <i>turbo</i>, <i>turbæ
ad focum</i>, <i>turfa</i>, occur for turf, in the years 1190, 1191, 1201
and 1210, as is proved by the instances quoted by Du Cange.
<i>Turbaria</i> for a turf-moor is found in Matthew Paris, who died
in 1259; <i>Turbagium</i>, in a diploma of Philip the Fair in the
year 1308, signifies the right of digging turf, as <i>turbare</i> does
to dig up turf. The word <i>mor</i> also is found in a document of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
the year 1246, quoted by Du Cange; who however has not introduced
it into his <span class="locked">dictionary<a name="FNanchor_586" id="FNanchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">586</a></span>. It seems to be the same as
<i>mariscus</i> and <i>marescus</i>. Brito, who lived about 1223, describing
the productions of Flanders, says, “Arida gleba foco
siccis incisa <span class="locked">marescis<a name="FNanchor_587" id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">587</a></span>.” That the last of these words signifies a
turf-bog is proved by a passage of Lambert, who lived at
Ardres about the year 1200: “Quendam similiter mariscum,
ut aiunt, proprium perfodi fecit, et in turbas dissecari.”</p>

<p>The assertion of Winsem and others, that the practice of
digging turf first became common after the year 1215, is
undoubtedly founded on information obtained from Sibrand
Leo’s Vitæ Abbatum Horti Divæ Virginis seu <span class="locked">Mariengard<a name="FNanchor_588" id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">588</a></span>;
but this writer died in 1588, and can by no means be adduced
as an evidence: he even says himself that turf-digging in 1212
was a new occupation.</p>

<p>The conjecture that the Netherlanders, who in the twelfth
century established themselves as colonists in some districts of
Germany, and particularly Lower Saxony, first made known
there the preparation and use of this kind of fuel is improbable,
or at any rate not <span class="locked">proved<a name="FNanchor_589" id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">589</a></span>. It is improbable, because the
Chauci, the oldest inhabitants of that country, burnt turf before
that period.</p>

<p>It is related by the Icelanders that Einar, Count or Earl of
Orkney or of the Orkney islands, discovered turf there, and on
that account was named Torffeinar. He was the son of Raugnwauld,
or Rognwald, earl of Mören, Sued and Nordmör in
Norway, in the time of the celebrated Norwegian King Harold,
commonly called Haarfager or Pulcricomus, on account of his
beautiful <span class="locked">hair<a name="FNanchor_590" id="FNanchor_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">590</a></span>. He must have lived therefore in the middle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
the ninth century; but on so trifling a subject I shall enter no
further into the labyrinth of the Icelandic Saga.</p>

<p>In Sweden turf was first made known at a very modern period
by some navigators in the district of Halland; and in
the time of Charles XI. much trouble was taken to introduce
it as fuel. In 1672 the town of Laholm obtained an exemption
from duty for the turf dug up in the lands belonging
to it.</p>

<p>In later times turf began to be burned to charcoal, sometimes
in kilns, and sometimes in furnaces built for that purpose,
by which this advantage is obtained, that it kindles sooner,
burns with less air, and forms a more moderate and uniform
fire without much smoke. This method of reducing turf to
charcoal, which is still practised in some parts of Bohemia,
Silesia, and Upper Saxony, was, it appears, proposed about the
year 1669, by the well-known John Joachim Becher, who
recommended at that time a method of depriving coals of their
sulphur by burning them, and the use of naphtha or rock-oil
procured from them by that <span class="locked">process<a name="FNanchor_591" id="FNanchor_591" href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">591</a></span>. The burning of turf
to coal seems to have been first made known in Germany by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
Hans Charles von Carlowitz, chamber-counsellor, and principal
surveyor of the mines of the electorate of <span class="locked">Saxony<a name="FNanchor_592" id="FNanchor_592" href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">592</a></span>. To save
wood and promote the benefit of the mines he sought for turf;
and having discovered it, he then endeavoured to find out
some method of rendering it fit to be employed in the melting-houses,
and this was the reducing to coal, which, as he himself
<span class="locked">says<a name="FNanchor_593" id="FNanchor_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">593</a></span>, he first attempted in kilns at Scheibenberg, in the year
1708. At the Brocken the first experiments were made in
1744, with turf which had been dug up several years. This
was announced by F. C. Brückman in <span class="locked">1745<a name="FNanchor_594" id="FNanchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">594</a></span>, as a new invention;
but an anonymous writer <span class="locked">stated<a name="FNanchor_595" id="FNanchor_595" href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">595</a></span> soon after, that this
charring had been long used in the district of Hadeln, and that
the smiths there employed no other kind of coals for their work.</p>

<p>[In 1842 a patent was taken out by Mr. Williams for compressing
peat into a dense mass, resembling coals. It is said
to be superior to coal in its properties of producing heat by
combustion, forming an excellent charcoal or coke. It is asserted
that this charcoal is much more combustible than that
of wood, and very useful in the manufacture of fire-works.
The process is as follows:&mdash;Immediately after being dug it is
triturated under revolving edge-wheels faced with iron plates
perforated all over the surface, and is forced by the pressure
through these apertures, till it becomes a kind of pap, which
is freed from the greater part of its moisture by a hydraulic
press. It is then dried, and converted into coke in the same
manner as pit-coal. The factitious coal of Mr. Williams is
made by incorporating pitch or rosin, melted in a caldron
with as much peat-charcoal ground to powder as will form a
tough doughy mass, which is then moulded into bricks.]</p>

have, however, discovered a method of burning both these to good coals, so
that they shall not only produce no smoke or bad smell, but yield a heat
as strong for melting metals as that of wood, and throw out such flames
that a foot of coal shall make a flame ten feet long. This I have demonstrated
at the Hague with turf, and proved here in England with coals, in
the presence of Mr. Boyle, by experiments made at Windsor on a large scale.
It deserves to be remarked on this occasion, that as the Swedes procure
their tar from fir-wood, I have procured tar from coals, which is in everything
equal to the Swedish, and even superior to it for some purposes. I
have tried it both on timber and ropes, and it has been found excellent.

<h2 id="artichoke">ARTICHOKE.</h2>

<p>That I might be able to investigate whether our artichoke was
known to the ancients, I have not only collected a variety of
scattered passages, compared them with one another and with
nature, and laboured through a tedious multitude of contradictions
and a confusion of names, but I have also been
obliged to examine a load of groundless conjectures, heaped
together by <span class="locked">commentators<a name="FNanchor_596" id="FNanchor_596" href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">596</a></span>, in order that I might understand
them and ascertain their value. By these means I have learned
more than seems hitherto to have been known; and I have
found that more is believed than can be proved; but that
the fruits of my toil will give complete satisfaction to my readers,
I do not pretend to hope. Before the botany, however,
and the natural history in general of the ancients can be properly
elucidated, before truth can be separated from falsehood,
what is certain from what is uncertain, and things defined
from those which are undefined, researches of this kind must
be undertaken, and the same method as that which I have
followed must be adopted.</p>

<p>The names of plants in ancient authors which have been
applied to our artichoke, are the following: <i>Cinara</i>, <i>Carduus</i>,
<i>Scolymus</i>, and <i>Cactus</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Cinara</i>, which is originally a Greek word, belonged
certainly to the thistle species; and the description of its top,
as given by <span class="locked">Columella<a name="FNanchor_597" id="FNanchor_597" href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">597</a></span>, seems, as has already been remarked
by <span class="locked">Nonnius<a name="FNanchor_598" id="FNanchor_598" href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">598</a></span> and others, to agree perfectly with that of our
artichoke. The <i>cinara</i> was commonly furnished with prickles,
but that was preferred which had lost them by cultivation, and
for which means were prescribed that did not produce the
desired <span class="locked">effect<a name="FNanchor_599" id="FNanchor_599" href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">599</a></span>. It was raised from seed sown in spring, but
was propagated also from slips or shoots which in Italy were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
planted in autumn, that they might bear earlier the next <span class="locked">summer<a name="FNanchor_600" id="FNanchor_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">600</a></span>.
The direction given to water these plants frequently,
is still followed by our gardeners in respect to their artichokes,
and they expect from this attention that the fruit will be more
abundant and tender. By this method many give to their
artichokes a superiority which others that have not been watered
so carefully cannot attain. A complaint, which occurs in ancient
authors, is also prevalent, that the roots are often destroyed
by mice. I do not, however, find it remarked what
part of the <i>cinara</i> was properly used, but it may be conjectured
it was the top, because the tender fruit is <span class="locked">praised<a name="FNanchor_601" id="FNanchor_601" href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">601</a></span>.</p>

<p><i>Carduus</i>, among the Romans, was the common name of all
plants of the thistle kind. It occurs among those of <span class="locked">weeds<a name="FNanchor_602" id="FNanchor_602" href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">602</a></span>, and
may be then properly translated by the word <i>thistle</i>. It, however,
often signified an eatable thistle; and this has given Pliny
occasion to make use of an insipid piece of raillery, when he
says that luxury prepared as food for man what would not be
eaten by cattle.</p>

<p>It is an old and common fault, that when the Greek and
Roman authors have not given us such descriptions of natural
objects as are sufficient to enable us to ascertain exactly what
they are, we suppose that they have been known under different
names, and a variety of characteristics are drawn together to
enable us to determine them. What, for example, we find
respecting the <i>cinara</i> is too little to give a just idea of the
plant; we read somewhat more of the <i>carduus</i>; and because
between these there seems to be an affinity, it is concluded that
the <i>cinara</i> and the <i>carduus</i> were the same plant; and everything
told us respecting both of them is thrown into one. Some
even go further, and add what they find under a third or a
fourth name. It is indeed true, that many natural objects
have had several names, and the species may sometimes be
rightly guessed; but conjecture ought never to be admitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
unless the identity can be fully established; else one may form
such a monstrous production as Horace has delineated, when
he says,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Humano capiti cervicem pictor equinam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jungere si velit, et varias inducere plumas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Undique collatis membris&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">I wish commentators would follow the example of our naturalists,
who consider a plant as a distinct species until it has been
proved on sure grounds that it is nothing else than a variety
of a plant already characterized. I should not therefore affirm
that the <i>cinara</i> and the <i>carduus</i> are the same, were I not able
to produce the following incontestable proofs in support of my
assertion.</p>

<p>In the first place, the Latins, Palladius and Pliny, give us
the same account of the <i>carduus</i> that Columella and the Greeks
do of the <i>cinara</i>. The former lost its prickles through <span class="locked">cultivation<a name="FNanchor_603" id="FNanchor_603" href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">603</a></span>;
its flowers were also of a purple <span class="locked">colour<a name="FNanchor_604" id="FNanchor_604" href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">604</a></span>; it was propagated
by seed and by shoots; it required frequent watering;
and it was remarked that it throve better when the earth
was mixed with ashes. Had not the <i>carduus</i> and the <i>cinara</i>
been the same, Palladius and Pliny would have mentioned the
latter; for we cannot suppose that they otherwise would have
omitted a plant that formed a dish so much esteemed and so
well-known among their countrymen. The latter claims to
himself the merit of having passed over no one that was held
in estimation. In the second place, Virgil has translated the
word <i>cynaros</i> in a part of Sophocles now lost, by <i>carduus</i><a name="FNanchor_605" id="FNanchor_605" href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">605</a>;
thirdly, Athenæus says expressly, that the <i>cinara</i> was by the
Latins named <i>cardus</i> and <i>carduus</i><a name="FNanchor_606" id="FNanchor_606" href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">606</a>; and, lastly, the old glossaries
explain <i>cinara</i> by <i>carduus</i>, as we are told by Salmasius.
On these grounds, therefore, I am of opinion that the <i>cinara</i>
and the <i>carduus</i> were the same.</p>

the <i>carduus</i> was dressed by the ancient cooks. The latter
gives directions for pickling it in vinegar; but neither of them
tells us what part of it was eaten. Lister thinks that Apicius
speaks of the tops of the young shoots, which, as far as I know,
are parts of the artichoke never eaten at present. It is, however,
worthy of remark, that the tops (<i>turiones</i>) of certain
kinds of the thistle family of plants, and among these the
common <span class="locked">burr<a name="FNanchor_609" id="FNanchor_609" href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">609</a></span>, are in some countries dressed and eaten like
asparagus. It is not improbable also that Pliny and Apicius
may have meant the ribs of the leaves; though none of the
ancients has taught us the art of binding up, covering with
earth, and blanching the <i>cinara</i> or <i>carduus</i>. This, perhaps,
was a new invention of the gardeners; and the cooks may
have had other methods of rendering the ribs of the leaves
tender and eatable. Had they meant the bottom of the calyx,
they would not have omitted to give a circumstantial account
of the preparation previous to its being pickled.</p>

<p>The <i>Scolymus</i> is by Pliny and Theophrastus reckoned to
belong to the genus of the thistles. The former says, that,
like most others of the same kind, the seeds were covered by
a sort of wool (<i>pappus</i>). It had a high stem, surrounded with
leaves, which were prickly, but which ceased to sting when
the plant <span class="locked">withered<a name="FNanchor_610" id="FNanchor_610" href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">610</a></span>. It flowered the whole summer through,
and had often flowers and ripe seed at the same time; which
is the case also with our artichoke plants. The calyx of the
<i>scolymus</i> was not <span class="locked">prickly<a name="FNanchor_611" id="FNanchor_611" href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">611</a></span>; the root was thick, black and
sweet, and contained a milky juice. It was eaten both raw
and cooked; and Theophrastus observes, as something very
remarkable, that when the plant was in flower, or, as others
explain the words, when it had finished blowing, it was most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
palatable. What renders this circumstance singular is, that
most milky roots used for food lose their milk and become
unfit to be eaten as soon as they have blown. This is the case
with the goat’s beard, which is eatable only the first year.</p>

<p>The <i>scolymus</i> however is not the only plant which forms
an exception; for the garden Scorzonera retains its milk, and
continues eatable after it has bloomed, and as long as it has
milk it may be used. According to Theophrastus and Pliny,
the roots of the <i>scolymus</i> are eatable. On the other hand,
Dioscorides says that the roots were not eaten, but the young
leaves only: as he informs us, however, that they were dressed
like asparagus, it would appear that he meant the young <span class="locked">shoots<a name="FNanchor_612" id="FNanchor_612" href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">612</a></span>.
Theophrastus expressly tells us, that, besides the roots, the
flowers also were used as food; and he calls that which was
eatable the pulpy part. We have, therefore, full proof that
the ancients ate the tops of some plants in the same manner as
we eat our artichokes.</p>

<p>It may however be asked, what kind of a plant was the <i>scolymus</i>?
That it was different from the <i>cinara</i> is undoubtedly
certain; for <span class="locked">Dioscorides<a name="FNanchor_613" id="FNanchor_613" href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">613</a></span> expressly distinguishes them; nor
was it the eatable <i>carduus</i>, for Pliny compares it with the <i>carduus</i>,
and says that it was characterized from the latter by
having roots fit to be eaten. Stapel is of opinion that the <i>scolymus</i>
is our artichoke; but this seems to me improbable, for
the leaves and roots of the latter are not sweet, but harsh and
bitter, and the calyx is prickly, which was not the case in the
<i>scolymus</i> of Theophrastus. Besides, I find nothing in the whole
description of the <i>scolymus</i> or in the accounts given us by the
ancients of the <i>cinara</i> and <i>carduus</i>, that can be applied to our
artichoke alone, and not to any other plant. It may be here
replied, that it would be very difficult to ascertain plants from
the names of the ancients, were such strong proofs required,
because they had not the art of separating the different genera
correctly, and of assigning to each certain characterizing marks.
This I allow; and for that reason it is impossible to elucidate
properly the Greek and Latin names of plants; but, in my
opinion, it is better to confess this impossibility, than to deceive
oneself with distant probabilities. Let the genus be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
ascertained when one cannot ascertain the species; let the
order to which the plant belongs be determined when one
cannot determine the genus; or, at least, let the class be assigned
when there is sufficient authority to do so. The <i>cinara</i>,
<i>carduus</i> and <i>scolymus</i> were therefore species of the thistle, of
which the roots and young shoots, and also the bottom of the
calyx of the last, were eaten. Were I appointed or condemned
to form a new Latin dictionary, I should explain the article
<i>Scolymus</i> in the following manner:&mdash;Planta composita, capitata.
Caulis longus, obsitus foliis spinosis. Radix carnosa,
lactescens, nigra, dulcis, edulis. Calyx squamis inermibus,
disco carnoso, ante efflorescentiam eduli. Semina papposa.
Turiones edules. This description, short as it is, contains
every thing that the ancients have said in order to characterize
that plant. It can, indeed, be understood only by those who
are acquainted with the terms of botany; but what follows
will require no explanation or defining of botanical names.</p>

<p>Should it be said that the <i>scolymus</i> must be our artichoke
because no other plant of the thistle kind is known the bottom
of the calyx of which is eatable, I would in answer observe:&mdash;First,
other species may have been known in ancient times,
which perhaps have been disused and forgotten since the more
pleasant and delicious artichoke became known. It is certain
that many old plants have in this manner been banished from
our gardens by the introduction of new ones. Thus have
common alexanders (<i>Smyrnium olusatrum</i>) fallen into neglect
since celery was made known by the Italians, about the end of
the seventeenth century; and so at present has the cultivation
of winter-cresses (<i>Erysimum barbarea</i>), bulbous-rooted chærophyllum
(<i>Chærophyllum bulbosum</i>), rocket (<i>Brassica eruca</i>),
and others, been abandoned since better vegetables have been
obtained to supply their place. Secondly, it is certain that,
even at present, the bottom of the calyx of some others of the
thistle-kind, besides the genus of the artichoke, is eaten; such
as the cotton-thistle (<i>Onopordum acanthium</i>), and the carline
thistle (<i>Carlina acaulis</i>), without mentioning the sun-flowers
which has been brought to us in modern times from South
America.</p>

<p>Without engaging to examine all the hypotheses of commentators
and ancient botanists on this subject, I shall take
notice of one conjecture, which, upon mature consideration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
appears to have some probability. <span class="locked">Clusius<a name="FNanchor_614" id="FNanchor_614" href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">614</a></span> is of opinion that
the plant called by the botanists of the seventeenth century
<i>Carduus chrysanthemus</i>, and by those of the present age <i>Scolymus
hispanicus</i>, the golden thistle, is the <i>scolymus</i> of Theophrastus;
because its leaves, beset with white prickles, and
its pulpy, sweet, milky roots are eaten, and excel in taste all
roots whatever, even those of skirret; and because it was collected
and sold in Spain, Italy, and Greece. But what has
principally attracted my attention to this conjecture, is the
account of <span class="locked">Bellon<a name="FNanchor_615" id="FNanchor_615" href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">615</a></span>, that this plant in Crete or Candia is called
still by the Greeks there <i>ascolymbros</i>. This name seems to
have arisen from <i>scolymos</i>; and besides <span class="locked">Stapel<a name="FNanchor_616" id="FNanchor_616" href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">616</a></span> found in an
old glossary the word <i>ascolymbros</i>. I am likewise convinced
that, as <span class="locked">Tournefort<a name="FNanchor_617" id="FNanchor_617" href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">617</a></span> has said, the botany of the ancients would
be much illustrated and rendered more certain, were the names
used by the modern Greeks known. It is certain that many
old names have been preserved till the present time with little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
variation; but nevertheless I can as little admit the assertion
of Clusius as that of Stapel; for <i>Scolymus hispanicus</i> has
neither the bottom of the calyx pulpy, nor wool adhering to
the seeds, like the <i>scolymus</i> of Theophrastus; and the young
roots only can be eaten, because, like those of most plants of
the genus of the thistle, they lose their milk when the flower
is in bloom; lastly, the leaves retain their power of pricking,
even after they have become withered.</p>

<p>The fourth name which, with any kind of probability, has
been translated by the word artichoke is <i>cactus</i>. This plant,
which, in the time of Theophrastus and Pliny, grew only in
Sicily and not in Greece, had broad prickly <span class="locked">leaves<a name="FNanchor_618" id="FNanchor_618" href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">618</a></span>; the flower
was filled with a kind of wool, which, when eaten inadvertently,
was <span class="locked">pernicious<a name="FNanchor_619" id="FNanchor_619" href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">619</a></span>; the calyx was prickly: and, besides a long
stem, it shot forth branches which crept along the <span class="locked">ground<a name="FNanchor_620" id="FNanchor_620" href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">620</a></span>,
and which, when the outer rind had been peeled off, were eaten
either fresh, or pickled in salt <span class="locked">water<a name="FNanchor_621" id="FNanchor_621" href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">621</a></span>. The bottom of the
calyx of this plant was likewise used, after it had been freed
from its seeds and woolly <span class="locked">substance<a name="FNanchor_622" id="FNanchor_622" href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">622</a></span>. It had a great resemblance
to the pith of the <span class="locked">palm-tree<a name="FNanchor_623" id="FNanchor_623" href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">623</a></span>.</p>

<p>That the <i>cactus</i> was different from the <i>scolymus</i> we are expressly
told by Theophrastus; and Pliny also distinguishes them
both from each other and from the <i>carduus</i>. Athenæus<a name="FNanchor_624" id="FNanchor_624" href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">624</a> is
the only author who says that the <i>cactus</i> and the <i>cinara</i> were
the same; but he gives no other proof than a very simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
etymology. It must therefore be admitted that the <i>cactus</i>
was a species of the thistle kind entirely different from any of
the former.</p>

<p>I think I have proved, therefore, that the Greeks and the
Romans used the pulpy bottom of the calyx, and the most tender
stalks and young shoots of some plants reckoned to belong to
the thistle kind, in the same manner as we use artichokes and
cardoons; and that the latter were unknown to them. It appears
to me probable that the use of these plants, at least in Italy and
Europe in general, was in the course of time laid aside and
forgotten, and that the artichoke, when it was first brought to
Italy from the Levant, was considered as a new species of food.
It is undoubtedly certain that our artichoke was first known
in that country in the fifteenth century. Hermolaus Barbarus,
who died in 1494, relates that this plant was first seen at Venice
in a garden in 1473, at which time it was very <span class="locked">scarce<a name="FNanchor_625" id="FNanchor_625" href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">625</a></span>.
About the year 1466, one of the family of Strozzi brought the
first artichokes to Florence from <span class="locked">Naples<a name="FNanchor_626" id="FNanchor_626" href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">626</a></span>. Politian, in a letter
in which he describes the dishes he found at a grand entertainment
in Italy in 1488, among these mentions <span class="locked">artichokes<a name="FNanchor_627" id="FNanchor_627" href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">627</a></span>. They
were introduced into France in the beginning of the sixteenth
<span class="locked">century<a name="FNanchor_628" id="FNanchor_628" href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">628</a></span>; and into England in the reign of Henry the <span class="locked">Eighth<a name="FNanchor_629" id="FNanchor_629" href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">629</a></span>.</p>

<p>Respecting the origin of the name various conjectures have
been formed, none of which, in my opinion, are founded even
on probability. Hermolaus Barbarus, Henry Stephen, Ruellius,
Heresbach, and others think that <i>artichoke</i> or <i>artichaut</i>,
as it is called by the French, and <i>arciocco</i> by the Italians, is
derived from the Greek word <i>coccalus</i>, which signifies a fircone,
with the Arabic article <i>al</i> prefixed, from which was
formed <i>alcocalon</i>, and afterwards the name now <span class="locked">used<a name="FNanchor_630" id="FNanchor_630" href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">630</a></span>. This
etymology is contradicted by <span class="locked">Salmasius<a name="FNanchor_631" id="FNanchor_631" href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">631</a></span>, who denies that
<i>coccalus</i> had ever that signification. He remarks also that artichokes
were by the Arabs called <i>harsaf</i>, <i>harxaf</i>, or <i>harchiaf</i>;
and he seems not disinclined to derive the name from these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
<span class="locked">appellations<a name="FNanchor_632" id="FNanchor_632" href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">632</a></span>. Grotius, Bodæus, and some others, derive it
from a Greek <span class="locked">word<a name="FNanchor_633" id="FNanchor_633" href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">633</a></span>, which occurs in Alexander Trallianus,
and which is supposed to signify our plant; but that word is
to be found in this author alone, and in him only once; so
that the idea of these critics appears to me very improbable.
Frisch affirms, in his dictionary, that our modern name is
formed from <i>carduus</i> and <i>scolymus</i> united. <span class="locked">Ihre<a name="FNanchor_634" id="FNanchor_634" href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">634</a></span> considers
the first part of the name as the German word <i>erde</i> (the earth),
because it is often pronounced <i>erdschoke</i>; but I rather think
that the Germans changed the foreign word <i>arti</i> into the word
<i>erde</i>, which was known to them, in the same manner as of <i>tartuffolo</i>
we have made <i>erdtoffeln</i><a name="FNanchor_635" id="FNanchor_635" href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">635</a>; besides, Ihre leaves the latter
part <span class="locked">unexplained<a name="FNanchor_636" id="FNanchor_636" href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">636</a></span>. In the seventeenth century the plant was
often called <i>Welsch distel</i> (Italian thistle), because the seeds
were procured from Italy, and also <i>Strobeldorn</i>, a word undoubtedly
derived from <i>strobilus</i>.</p>

<p>Were the original country of the artichoke really known, the
etymology of the name, perhaps, might be easily explained.
Linnæus says that it grew wild in Narbonne, Italy, and Sicily,
and the cardoons in Crete; but, in my opinion, the information
respecting the latter has been taken only from the above-quoted
passage of Bellon, which is improperly supposed to
allude to the artichoke. As far as I know, it was not found
upon that island either by Tournefort or any other traveller.
Garidel, however, mentions the artichoke under the name given
it by Bauhin, <i>cinara sylvestris latifolia</i>, among the plants growing
wild in Provence; but later authors assure us that they
sought for it there in <span class="locked">vain<a name="FNanchor_637" id="FNanchor_637" href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">637</a></span>. I shall here remark that the artichoke
is certainly known in Persia; but Tavernier says expressly
that it was carried thither, like asparagus, and other
European vegetables of the kitchen-garden, by the Carmelite
and other monks; and that it was only in later times that it
became <span class="locked">common<a name="FNanchor_638" id="FNanchor_638" href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">638</a></span>.</p>

<h2 id="saw">SAW-MILLS.</h2>

<p>In early periods, the trunks of trees were split with wedges into
as many and as thin pieces as <span class="locked">possible<a name="FNanchor_639" id="FNanchor_639" href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">639</a></span>; and if it was necessary
to have them still thinner, they were hewn on both sides to
the proper size. This simple and wasteful manner of making
boards has been still continued to the present time. Peter the
Great of Russia endeavoured to put a stop to it by forbidding
hewn deals to be transported on the river Neva. The saw,
however, though so convenient and beneficial, has not been
able to banish entirely the practice of splitting timber used in
building, or in making furniture and utensils, for I do not speak
here of fire-wood; and, indeed, it must be allowed that this
method is attended with peculiar advantages, which that of
sawing can never possess. The wood-splitters perform their
work more expeditiously than sawyers, and split timber is
much stronger than that which has been sawn; for the fissure
follows the grain of the wood, and leaves it whole; whereas
the saw, which proceeds in the line chalked out for it, divides the
fibres, and by these means lessens its cohesion and solidity.
Split timber, indeed, turns out often crooked and warped; but
in many purposes to which it is applied this is not prejudicial;
and such faults may sometimes be amended. As the fibres,
however, retain their natural length and direction, thin boards,
particularly, can be bent much better. This is a great advantage
in making pipe-staves, or sieve-frames, which require still
more art, and in forming various implements of the like kind.</p>

<p>Our common saw, which needs only to be guided by the hand
of the workman, however simple it may be, was not known to
the inhabitants of America when they were subdued by the
<span class="locked">Europeans<a name="FNanchor_640" id="FNanchor_640" href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">640</a></span>. The inventor of this instrument has by the Greeks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
been inserted in their mythology, with a place in which, among
their gods, they honoured the greatest benefactors of the earliest
ages. By some he is called Talus, and by others Perdix.
<span class="locked">Pliny<a name="FNanchor_641" id="FNanchor_641" href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">641</a></span> alone ascribes the invention to Dædalus; but Hardouin,
in the passage where he does so, chooses to read Talus rather
than Dædalus. In my opinion, Pliny may have committed
an error as well as any of the moderns; and as one writer at
present misleads another, <span class="locked">Seneca<a name="FNanchor_642" id="FNanchor_642" href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">642</a></span>, who gives the same inventor,
may have fallen into a mistake by copying Pliny. Diodorus
<span class="locked">Siculus<a name="FNanchor_643" id="FNanchor_643" href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">643</a></span>, <span class="locked">Apollodorus<a name="FNanchor_644" id="FNanchor_644" href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">644</a></span>, and others name the inventor
Talus. He was the son of Dædalus’s sister; and was by his
mother placed under the tuition of her brother, to be instructed
in his art. Having once found the jaw-bone of a snake, he
employed it to cut through a small piece of wood; and by
these means was induced to form a like instrument of iron,
that is, to make a saw. This invention, which greatly facilitates
labour, excited the envy of his master, and instigated him
to put Talus to death privately. We are told, that being asked
by some one, when he was burying the body, what he was
depositing in the earth, he replied, a serpent. This suspicious
answer discovered the murder; and thus, adds the historian, a
snake was the cause of the invention, of the murder, and of its
being found <span class="locked">out<a name="FNanchor_645" id="FNanchor_645" href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">645</a></span>.</p>

<p>Hyginus<a name="FNanchor_646" id="FNanchor_646" href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">646</a>, <span class="locked">Servius<a name="FNanchor_647" id="FNanchor_647" href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">647</a></span>, <span class="locked">Fulgentius<a name="FNanchor_648" id="FNanchor_648" href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">648</a></span>, Lactantius <span class="locked">Placidus<a name="FNanchor_649" id="FNanchor_649" href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">649</a></span>, <span class="locked">Isidorus<a name="FNanchor_650" id="FNanchor_650" href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">650</a></span>,
and others call the inventor Perdix. That he was the
son of a sister of Dædalus they all agree; but they differ respecting
the name of his parents. The mother, by Fulgentius,
is called Polycastes, but without any proof; and Lactantius
gives to the father the name of Calaus. In Apollodorus, however,
the mother of Talus is called Perdix; and the same name
is given by Tzetzes to the mother of the inventor, whose name
Talus he changes into <span class="locked">Attalus<a name="FNanchor_651" id="FNanchor_651" href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">651</a></span>. Perdix, we are told, did not
employ for a saw the jaw-bone of a snake, like Talus, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
back-bone of a fish; and this is confirmed by <span class="locked">Ovid<a name="FNanchor_652" id="FNanchor_652" href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor"
>652</a></span>, who
nevertheless is silent respecting the name of the inventor.</p>

<p>What may be meant by <i>spina piscis</i> it is perhaps difficult to
conjecture; but I can by no means make <i>spina dorsi</i> of it, as
Dion. Salvagnius has done, in his observations on the passage
quoted from Ovid’s Ibis. The small bony processes which
project from the spine of a fish have some similitude to a saw;
but it would be hardly possible to saw through with them
small pieces of wood. These bones are too long, as well as
too far distant from each other; and the joints of the back-bone
are liable to be dislocated by the smallest force. I am
not acquainted with the spine of any fish which would be sufficiently
strong for that purpose. The jaw-bone of a fish furnished
with teeth would be more proper; but the words <i>spina
in medio pisce</i> prevent us from adopting that alteration. I
should be inclined rather to explain this difficulty by the bone
which projects from the snout of the saw-fish, called by the
Romans <i>serra</i>, and by the Greeks <i>pristis</i>. That bone, indeed,
might not be altogether unfit for such a use: the teeth are
strongly united to the broad bone in the middle, and are capable
of resisting a great force; but they are placed at rather
too great a distance. The old inhabitants of Madeira, however,
we are told, really used this bone instead of a <span class="locked">saw<a name="FNanchor_653" id="FNanchor_653" href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">653</a></span>.
That Talus found the jaw-bone of a snake with teeth like a
saw is extremely probable, for there are many snakes which
have teeth of that kind.</p>

<p>The saws of the Grecian carpenters had the same form, and
were made in the like ingenious manner as ours are at present.
This is fully shown by a painting still preserved among
the antiquities of <span class="locked">Herculaneum<a name="FNanchor_654" id="FNanchor_654" href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">654</a></span>. Two genii are represented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
at the end of a bench, which consists of a long table that rests
upon two four-footed stools. The piece of wood which is to
be sawn through is secured by cramps. The saw with which
the genii are at work has a perfect resemblance to our frame-saw.
It consists of a square frame, having in the middle a
blade, the teeth of which stand perpendicular to the plane of
the frame. The piece of wood which is to be sawn extends
beyond the end of the bench, and one of the workmen appears
standing and the other sitting on the ground. The
arms, in which the blade is fastened, have the same form as
that given to them at present. In the bench are seen holes,
in which the cramps that hold the timber are stuck. They
are shaped like the figure seven; and the ends of them reach
below the boards that form the top of it. The French call a
cramp of this kind <i>un valet</i><a name="FNanchor_655" id="FNanchor_655" href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">655</a>.</p>

<p>Montfaucon<a name="FNanchor_656" id="FNanchor_656" href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">656</a> also has given the representation of two
ancient saws taken from Gruter. One of them seems to be
only the blade of a saw without any frame; but the other
figure I consider as a cross-cut saw; and I think I can distinguish
all the parts, though it is imperfectly delineated. One
may however perceive both the handles between which the
blade is fastened; the wooden bar that binds them together,
though the blade is delineated too near it; and about the
middle of this bar, the piece of wood that tightens the cord
which keeps the handles as well as the whole instrument firm.
Saws which were not placed in a frame, but fastened to a handle,
are thus described by <span class="locked">Palladius<a name="FNanchor_657" id="FNanchor_657" href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">657</a></span>:&mdash;“Serrulæ manubriatæ
minores majoresque ad mensuram cubiti, quibus facile est,
quod per serram fieri non potest, resecando trunco arboris,
aut vitis interseri.”</p>

<p>The most beneficial and ingenious improvement of this instrument
was, without doubt, the invention of saw-mills,
which are driven either by water, wind, [or by steam]. Mills
of the first kind were erected so early as the fourth century,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
in Germany, on the small river Roer or <span class="locked">Ruer<a name="FNanchor_658" id="FNanchor_658" href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">658</a></span>; for though
Ausonius speaks properly of water-mills for cutting stone, and
not timber, it cannot be doubted that these were invented later
than mills for manufacturing deals, or that both kinds were
erected at the same time. The art however of cutting marble
with a saw is very old. <span class="locked">Pliny<a name="FNanchor_659" id="FNanchor_659" href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">659</a></span> conjectures that it was invented
in Caria; at least he knew no building incrusted with
marble of greater antiquity than the palace of king Mausolus,
at Halicarnassus. This edifice is celebrated by <span class="locked">Vitruvius<a name="FNanchor_660" id="FNanchor_660" href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">660</a></span>,
for the beauty of its marble; and Pliny gives an account of
the different kinds of sand used for cutting it; for it is the
sand properly, says he, and not the saw, which produces that
effect. The latter presses down the former, and rubs it against
the marble; and the coarser the sand is, the longer will be
the time required to polish the marble which has been cut by
it. Stones of the soap-rock kind, which are indeed softer
than marble, and which would require less force than wood,
were sawn at that <span class="locked">period<a name="FNanchor_661" id="FNanchor_661" href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">661</a></span>: but it appears that the far harder
glassy kinds of stone were sawn then also; for we are told of
the discovery of a building which was encrusted with cut
agate, cornelian, lapis lazuli, and <span class="locked">amethysts<a name="FNanchor_662" id="FNanchor_662" href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">662</a></span>. I have, however,
found no account in any of the Greek or Roman writers
of a mill for sawing wood; and as the writers of modern times
speak of saw-mills as new and uncommon, it would seem that
the oldest construction of them has been forgotten, or that
some important improvement has made them appear entirely
new.</p>

<p>Becher says, with his usual confidence, that saw-mills were
invented in the seventeenth <span class="locked">century<a name="FNanchor_663" id="FNanchor_663" href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">663</a></span>. Though this is certainly
false, I did not expect to find that there were saw-mills
in the neighbourhood of Augsburg so early as the year 1337,
as <span class="locked">Stetten<a name="FNanchor_664" id="FNanchor_664" href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">664</a></span> has discovered by the town-books of that place.
I shall here insert his own words, in answer to a request I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
made that he would be so kind as to communicate to me all
the information he knew on that subject:&mdash;“You are desirous
of reading that passage in our town-books, where saw-mills
are first mentioned; but it is of very little importance.
There is to be found only under the year 1338 the name of a
burgher called Giss Saegemuller; and though it may be objected
that one cannot from the name infer the existence of
the employment, I am of a different opinion; especially as I
have lately been able to obtain a proof much more to be depended
on. In the surveyors’ book, which I have often before
quoted, and which, perhaps, for many centuries has not
been seen or consulted by any one, I find under the year
1322, and several times afterwards, sums disbursed under the
following title: Molitori dicto Hanrey pro asseribus et swaertlingis.
Schwartlings, among us, are the outside deals of the
trunk, which in other places are called <i>Schwarten</i>. This
word, therefore, makes the existence of a saw-mill pretty certain.
As a confirmation of this idea, we have still a mill of
that kind which is at present called the Hanrey-mill; and
the stream which supplies it with water is called the Hanrey-brook.
Since the earliest ages, the ground on which this mill,
and the colour, stamping, and oil-mills in the neighbourhood
are built, was the property of the hospital of the Holy Ghost.
By that hospital it was given as a life-rent to a rich burgher
named Erlinger, but returned again in 1417 by his daughter
Anna Bittingerin, who had, above and under the Hanrey-mill,
two other saw-mills, which still exist, and for which, in
virtue of an order of council of that year, she entered into a
contract with the hospital in regard to the water and mill-dams.”
There were saw-mills, therefore, at Augsburg so
early as 1322. This appears to be highly probable also from
the circumstance, that such mills occur very often in the following
century in many other countries.</p>

<p>When the Infant Henry sent settlers to the island of Madeira,
which was discovered in 1420, and caused European fruits of
every kind to be carried thither, he ordered saw-mills to be
erected also, for the purpose of sawing into deals the various
species of excellent timber with which the island abounded,
and which were afterwards transported to <span class="locked">Portugal<a name="FNanchor_665" id="FNanchor_665" href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">665</a></span>. About<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
the year 1427 the city of Breslau had a saw-mill which produced
a yearly rent of three marks; and in 1490 the magistrates
of Erfurt purchased a forest, in which they caused a
saw-mill to be erected, and they rented another mill in the
neighbourhood besides. Norway, which is covered with forests,
had the first saw-mill about the year 1530. This mode
of manufacturing timber was called the new art; and because
the exportation of deals was by these means increased, that
circumstance gave occasion to the deal-tythe, introduced by
Christian III. in the year <span class="locked">1545<a name="FNanchor_666" id="FNanchor_666" href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">666</a></span>. Soon after the celebrated
Henry Ranzau caused the first mill of this kind to be built in
<span class="locked">Holstein<a name="FNanchor_667" id="FNanchor_667" href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">667</a></span>. In 1552 there was a saw-mill at Joachimsthal,
which, as we are told, belonged to Jacob Geusen, mathematician.
In the year 1555 the bishop of Ely, ambassador from
Mary queen of England to the court of Rome, having seen a
saw-mill in the neighbourhood of Lyons, the writer of his
travels thought it worthy of a particular <span class="locked">description<a name="FNanchor_668" id="FNanchor_668" href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">668</a></span>. In the
sixteenth century, however, there were mills with different
saw-blades, by which a plank could be cut into several deals
at the same time. Pighius saw one of these, in 1575, on the
Danube, near Ratisbon, when he accompanied Charles, prince
of Juliers and Cleves, on his <span class="locked">travels<a name="FNanchor_669" id="FNanchor_669" href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">669</a></span>. It may here be asked
whether the Dutch had such mills first, as is commonly <span class="locked">believed<a name="FNanchor_670" id="FNanchor_670" href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">670</a></span>.
The first saw-mill was erected in Holland at Saardam,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
in the year 1596; and the invention of it is ascribed to
Cornelis <span class="locked">Cornelissen<a name="FNanchor_671" id="FNanchor_671" href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">671</a></span>; but he is as little the inventor as the
mathematician of Joachimsthal. Perhaps he was the first
person who built a saw-mill at that place, which is a village of
great trade, and has still a great many saw-mills, though the
number of them is becoming daily less; for within the last
thirty years a hundred have been given <span class="locked">up<a name="FNanchor_672" id="FNanchor_672" href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">672</a></span>. The first mill of
this kind in Sweden was erected in the year <span class="locked">1653<a name="FNanchor_673" id="FNanchor_673" href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">673</a></span>. At present,
that kingdom possesses the largest perhaps ever constructed
in Europe, where a water-wheel, twelve feet broad,
drives at the same time seventy-two saws.</p>

<p>In England saw-mills had at first the same fate that printing
had in Turkey, the ribbon-loom in the dominions of the Church,
and the crane at Strasburgh. When attempts were made to
introduce them they were violently opposed, because it was
apprehended that the sawyers would be deprived by them of
their means of getting a subsistence. For this reason it was
found necessary to abandon a saw-mill erected by a Dutchman
near <span class="locked">London<a name="FNanchor_674" id="FNanchor_674" href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">674</a></span>, in 1663; and in the year 1700, when one
Houghton laid before the nation the advantages of such a mill,
he expressed his apprehension that it might excite the rage of
the <span class="locked">populace<a name="FNanchor_675" id="FNanchor_675" href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">675</a></span>. What he dreaded was actually the case in
1767 or 1768, when an opulent timber-merchant, by the desire
and approbation of the Society of Arts, caused a saw-mill,
driven by wind, to be erected at Limehouse under the direction
of James Stansfield, who had learned, in Holland and
Norway, the art of constructing and managing machines of
that kind. A mob assembled and pulled the mill to pieces;
but the damage was made good by the nation, and some of the
rioters were punished. A new mill was afterwards erected,
which was suffered to work without molestation, and which
gave occasion to the erection of <span class="locked">others<a name="FNanchor_676" id="FNanchor_676" href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">676</a></span>. It appears, however,
that this was not the only mill of the kind then in Britain;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
for one driven also by wind had been built at Leith, in Scotland,
some years <span class="locked">before<a name="FNanchor_677" id="FNanchor_677" href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">677</a></span>.</p>

<p>[The application of the steam-engine has in modern times
almost entirely displaced the use of either water or wind as
sources of power in machinery, and most of the saw-mills now
in action, especially those on a large scale, are worked by
steam. Some idea of the precision with which their operations
are now accomplished may be obtained from the following
fact. At the City of London saw-mills, the largest log of wood
which had been placed on the carriage in one piece&mdash;a log of
Honduras mahogany 18 feet long and three feet one inch
square,&mdash;was cut into unbroken sheets at the rate of ten to an
inch, and so beautifully smooth as to require scarcely any
dressing.]</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="stamped">STAMPED PAPER.</h2>

<p>Paper stamped with a certain mark by Government, and
which in many countries must be used for all judicial acts,
public deeds, and private contracts, in order to give them
validity, is one of those numerous modes of taxation invented
after the other means of raising money for the service of states,
or rather of their rulers, became exhausted. It is not of great
antiquity; for before the invention of our paper it would not
have been a very productive source of finance. When parchment
and other substances employed for writing on were
dear, when greater simplicity of manners produced more
honesty and more confidence among mankind, and when
tallies supplied the place of notes, bonds, and receipts, writings
of that kind were very little in use.</p>

<p>De Basville, however, in his Mémoires pour servir à l’histoire
de Languedoc, affirms that stamped paper was introduced
so early as the year 537, by the emperor Justinian. This
book, written by the author, intendant of that province in 1697,
for the use of the duke of Burgundy, was printed, in octavo,
at Marseilles in 1734, and not at Amsterdam, as announced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
in the title; but it was carefully suppressed by the Government,
and on that account is very scarce even in <span class="locked">France<a name="FNanchor_678" id="FNanchor_678" href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">678</a></span>. I
have never seen it; but I know the author’s ideas respecting
stamped paper, from an extract in Variétés Historiques, Physiques,
et Littéraires, printed at Paris in the year <span class="locked">1752<a name="FNanchor_679" id="FNanchor_679" href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">679</a></span>. The
author of this work supports the opinion of his countryman:
but it is undoubtedly false; for the law quoted as a proof requires
only that documents should be written on such paper
as had marked at the top (which was called the protocoll) the
name of the intendant of the finances, and the time when the
paper was made; and this regulation was established merely
with a view to prevent the forging and altering of acts or
<span class="locked">deeds<a name="FNanchor_680" id="FNanchor_680" href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">680</a></span>. A kind of stamped paper therefore was brought into
use, though different from what we have at present, the principal
intention of which is not to render writings more secure,
but by imposing a certain duty on the stamps, proportioned to
the importance of the purpose it is employed for, to make a
considerable addition to the public <span class="locked">revenue<a name="FNanchor_681" id="FNanchor_681" href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">681</a></span>. The stamps
serve as a receipt to show that the tax has been paid; and,
though many law papers must be stamped, that burthen has
tended as little to prevent law-suits as the stamping of cards
has to lessen gaming: though some think differently. In both
too much is risked and too much expected for taxes to deter
mankind from engaging in either.</p>

<p>If in this historical research we look only to the antiquity of
stamping, we shall find that both the Greeks and the Romans
had soldiers marked in that manner; and, if we may be allowed
to bring together things so different, we might include under
the like head those runaway slaves who were marked by
being branded; but I allude here only to the stamped paper
now in use, which was certainly invented in Holland, a country
where every necessary of life is subjected to taxation. The
States of the United Provinces having promised a reward to
any one who should invent a new impost, that might at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
same time bear light on the people and be productive to the
government, some person proposed that of <i>bezegelde brieven</i>,
or stamped paper, which was approved; and which Boxhorn,
to whom we are indebted for this information, considers as a
very proper tax. He is of opinion also that it might with great
advantage be adopted in other <span class="locked">countries<a name="FNanchor_682" id="FNanchor_682" href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">682</a></span>; and this was really
the case soon after his death, which happened in 1653.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
Stamped paper was introduced in Holland on the 13th of
August, 1624, by an ordinance which represented the necessity
and great benefit of this new tax. Among other things advanced
in its favour, it was said that it would tend to lessen
law-suits, and, on that account, would soon recommend itself to
neighbouring nations. What we are told therefore by the
author of an extract in Variétés Historiques, before-quoted,
that stamped paper began to be used in Holland and Spain
so early as the year 1555, is certainly false. The Spaniards
may, indeed, have been the first people who followed the example
of the Dutch; for the author above mentioned asserts,
that he saw an act, executed by a notary at Brussels, in 1668,
which was written on stamped paper.</p>

<p>This tax was introduced in the electorate of Saxony by an
ordinance of the 22nd of March 1682; and into that of Brandenburg
on the 15th of July, in the same year. Bartholdus
however says, but without producing any <span class="locked">proof<a name="FNanchor_683" id="FNanchor_683" href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">683</a></span>, that stamped
paper was used before that period in Denmark, Florence, and
Silesia. In Hanover it was first introduced, as I think, on the
20th of February, 1709.</p>

<p>[The stamp-tax was first introduced into this country in the
reign of William and Mary, in 1693 (5 W. &amp; M. c. 21). This
act imposes stamps upon grants from the crown, diplomas,
contracts, probates of wills and letters of administration, and
upon all writs, proceedings, and records in courts of law and
equity; it does not however seem to impose stamps upon deeds,
unless these are enrolled at Westminster or other courts of
record. Two years afterwards, conveyances, deeds and leases,
were subjected to the stamp duty, and by a series of acts in the
succeeding reigns, every instrument recording a transaction
between two individuals was subjected to a stamp duty before
it could be used in a court of justice. These laws have been
variously altered in later times, but it is beyond our province
to trace them further.]</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a name="Footnote_682" id="Footnote_682" href="#FNanchor_682" class="fnanchor">682</a>  “The States of Holland having laid sufficiently heavy duties on merchandise
of every kind, and these not being equal to the expenditure, which
was daily increasing, began to think of imposing new ones. For that purpose
they issued an edict, inviting the ingenious to turn their thoughts
towards that subject, and offering a very ample reward to whoever should
invent a new tax, that might be as little burdensome as possible, and yet
productive to the republic. Some shrewd, deep-thinking person, at length
devised one on stamped paper (called <i>de impost van bezegelde brieven</i>), to
be paid for all paper impressed with the seal of the States. The inventor
proposed, that it should be enacted by public authority, that no petitions
from the states, or from the magistrates of any city or district, or any public
bodies, should be received; that no documents should be admitted in
courts of justice; that no receipts should be legal, and that no acts signed
by notaries, secretaries, or other persons in office, and, in short, no contracts
should be valid, except such as were written upon paper to which the seal
of the States had been affixed, in the manner above-mentioned. It was
proposed, also, that this paper should be sold by the clerks of the different
towns and courts at the following rate; paper impressed with the great seal
of the States for sixpence, and that with the less seal for twopence per sheet:
for according to the importance of the business it was necessary that the
great or less seal should be used. The States approved this plan, and it was
immediately put in execution.”&mdash;Boxhornii Disquisitiones Politic. casus 59.
In this collection there is also Boxhornii Reip. Bataviæ Brevis et Accurata
Descriptio, in the eighth chapter of which the author gives the following
account of the origin of stamped paper:&mdash;“A very ingenious method has
lately been invented of raising large sums of money for the use of the republic.
As there are many rich people who have entrusted a considerable
share of their property to the public treasury, the interest of which they
receive annually on giving receipts; as many law-suits are carried on which
are generally entered into by the wealthy, and which cannot be brought
to a conclusion until a variety of instruments, as they are called, have been
executed on each side; and as, on account of the flourishing state of trade,
many contracts are made, which, for the sake of security, must be mutually
signed, the States thought proper to enact by a public edict, that no receipts,
law-papers, contracts, or instruments of the like kind, should be legal or
valid, unless written on paper impressed with the great or small seal of the
States. A price was also fixed on the paper, to be paid by those who had
occasion for it; so that a sheet which before could be purchased for a half-penny,
was raised to several pence; and it is incredible how great a revenue
these sheets bring to the public, by so many of them being used. The poor,
however, and those of small fortune, feel little of this burden, as the rich
principally are concerned in the transactions above-mentioned.”</p></div>

<h2 id="insurance">INSURANCE.</h2>

<p>Insurance, that excellent establishment by which losses that
would entirely ruin a merchant, being divided among a company,
are rendered supportable, and almost imperceptible; by
which undertakings too great for one person are easily accomplished,
and by which commodities brought from the most
distant regions are made <span class="locked">cheaper<a name="FNanchor_684" id="FNanchor_684" href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">684</a></span>, appears not to have been
known to the Romans, however near they may have come to
the invention of it. If we examine closely the information from
which some endeavour to prove the contrary, it will be found
that it is far from sufficient to support their opinion.</p>

<p>Puffendorf<a name="FNanchor_685" id="FNanchor_685" href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">685</a>, <span class="locked">Barbeyrac<a name="FNanchor_686" id="FNanchor_686" href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">686</a></span>, <span class="locked">Loccenius<a name="FNanchor_687" id="FNanchor_687" href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">687</a></span>, <span class="locked">Kulpis<a name="FNanchor_688" id="FNanchor_688" href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">688</a></span>, and others,
ground their assertions on a passage of <span class="locked">Livy<a name="FNanchor_689" id="FNanchor_689" href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">689</a></span>, who says, that
when the Roman army in Spain was distressed for provisions,
clothing and other necessaries, a company engaged to convey
to them everything they stood in need of, under the stipulation
that the State should make good their loss, in case their vessels
should be shipwrecked by storms, or be taken by the enemy;
and we are told that these terms were agreed to. This was
undoubtedly a promise of indemnification, but by no means an
insurance, in which it is always necessary that a premium
should be given. On occasions of this kind, however, acts of
fraud were practised, like those committed at present, to the
prejudice of insurers. Shipwrecks were pretended to have
happened which never took place; and old shattered vessels,
freighted with articles of little value, were purposely sunk, and
the crew saved in boats; and large sums were then demanded
as a reimbursement for the <span class="locked">loss<a name="FNanchor_690" id="FNanchor_690" href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">690</a></span>.</p>

<p>Little more is proved by a passage of <span class="locked">Suetonius<a name="FNanchor_691" id="FNanchor_691" href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">691</a></span>, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
Kulpis and others consider as affording an instance of insurance.
That author tells us, that the emperor Claudius promised to
indemnify merchants for their losses, if their ships should perish
by storms at sea. This passage Anderson must not have read;
else he would not have said that Suetonius ascribed the invention
of insurance to Claudius.</p>

<p>In Simon’s edition of Grotius, a passage is quoted from
Cicero’s <span class="locked">epistles<a name="FNanchor_692" id="FNanchor_692" href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">692</a></span> as an instance of insurance among the Romans,
which seems to be more probable. Cicero says he hopes
to find at Laodicea security, by means of which he can remit
the money of the republic, without being exposed to any danger
on its passage. The word <i>prædes</i> may here signify insurers;
but, in my opinion, this quotation ought rather to be classed
among those which have been collected by Ayrer, as the first
traces of bills of <span class="locked">exchange<a name="FNanchor_693" id="FNanchor_693" href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor">693</a></span>.</p>

<p>Those remains of the ancient laws which, according to Kulpis
and others, allude to insurance, concern bottomry (<i>fœnus
nauticum</i>) only; and that this is much older than insurance
has been already fully proved by <span class="locked">Stypman<a name="FNanchor_694" id="FNanchor_694" href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">694</a></span>.</p>

<p>Malynes<a name="FNanchor_695" id="FNanchor_695" href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">695</a>, Anderson, and others affirm, that insurance is
mentioned in the marine laws of the Isle of Oleron. This
island, which lies opposite to the mouth of the Charente, on
the coast of France, was much celebrated in the eleventh,
twelfth, and following centuries on account of its trade. It
belonged then to the duke of Aquitaine, and came to the crown
of England by the marriage of Eleonora, daughter of the last
duke, with Henry II. Under Eleonora were framed in the
island those laws so well-known by the names <i>Roole d’Oleron</i>,
<i>Roole des Jugemens d’Oleron</i>, that, like the laws of the Rhodians,
they were used also by foreigners. These laws were afterwards
enlarged and improved by Richard I., Eleonora’s son;
at least we are assured so by the French historians: but the
English ascribe them to Richard alone. In order to determine
the period when they were framed, I shall only observe that
Eleonora died in the year 1202, and Richard in 1199; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
Anderson, therefore, not without probability, places the origin
of them in the year 1194. A copy of these laws, printed at
Rouen, is still preserved, in which it is said that they were first
drawn up in 1266. This, however, the French and the English
declare to be <span class="locked">false<a name="FNanchor_696" id="FNanchor_696" href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">696</a></span>. They are written in French, that is, in the old
Gascon dialect. I am acquainted with them from the following
scarce book, the author of which, in the preface, calls himself
Cleirac: Us et Coutumes de la <span class="locked">Mer<a name="FNanchor_697" id="FNanchor_697" href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">697</a></span>; but I find no traces in
them of insurance. Even Cleirac himself, who has given an
excellent explanation of the laws of Oleron, seems not to have
found any; for where he relates everything he knew respecting
the history of it, he ascribes this invention, and also that of
bills of exchange, to the Jews, who made use of it when they were
expelled from France. According to Cleirac, insurance was long
detested by the Christians, who at that time considered it as a
sin to take interest; and the use of it, as well as of bills of exchange,
was first made common by the Guelphs and Ghibelines.
Of this pretended service of the Jews in regard to insurance,
I know no proof.</p>

<p>The celebrated maritime laws of the city of Wisby, in the
island of Gothland, whether of later date, as the French assert,
or older, which is more probable, than those of Oleron,
are equally silent with respect to insurance. These laws were
not written originally in Swedish, as <span class="locked">l’Estocq<a name="FNanchor_698" id="FNanchor_698" href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">698</a></span> says, but in
the Low-German. The translation into High-German by
<span class="locked">Marquard<a name="FNanchor_699" id="FNanchor_699" href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">699</a></span> is incorrect, and the French one of Cleirac is too
free and too much abridged. The Dutch translation published
at Amsterdam is the <span class="locked">completest<a name="FNanchor_700" id="FNanchor_700" href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">700</a></span>.</p>

<p>Insurance was, undoubtedly, not known at the time when
the later Hanseatic maritime laws were framed, else it would
have been mentioned in them. Of these laws there are various
editions. One of those most used is that by Kericke,
which is inserted also in Heineccii Scriptorum de Jure Nautico
et Maritimo Fasciculus. Cleirac has given a French
translation of them.</p>

<p>As little respecting insurance is to be found in Il Consolato
del Mare. These maritime laws, highly worthy of notice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
were originally written in the Catalonian dialect; and it seems
very probable that they were drawn up at Barcelona. A
part of them appears to have been framed in the eleventh,
but the greater part in the thirteenth century; for the book
itself proves, in more than one place, that they are not all of
the same antiquity. The most correct edition is that published
at Leyden in <span class="locked">1704<a name="FNanchor_701" id="FNanchor_701" href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">701</a></span>. Those writers who have pretended
that insurance is mentioned in these Catalonian maritime
laws have, perhaps, been led into this error, because, in
an appendix to some of the common editions, there is a short
account of insurance as once practised at Barcelona. As I
have never seen this small treatise, I do not know whether it
contains anything respecting the history of it. The oldest
laws and regulations concerning insurance, with which I am
at present acquainted, are the following.</p>

<p>On the 28th of January 1523, five persons appointed for
that purpose drew up at Florence some articles which are still
employed on the exchange at Leghorn. These important
regulations, together with the prescribed form of policies,
which may be considered as the <span class="locked">oldest<a name="FNanchor_702" id="FNanchor_702" href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">702</a></span>, have been inserted, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
Italian and German, by Magens, in his Treatise on Insurance,
Average and <span class="locked">Bottomry<a name="FNanchor_703" id="FNanchor_703" href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">703</a></span>, published at Hamburgh in 1753.
I should have been glad to have found in Italian authors some
information respecting the antiquity of these <span class="locked">regulations<a name="FNanchor_704" id="FNanchor_704" href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">704</a></span>, a
copy of which Magens says he procured from Leghorn; but
I have hitherto sought for it in vain. Straccha however mentions
a Florentine order of June the 15th, 1526, which forbids
common insurance, unless the goods and commodities are <span class="locked">specified<a name="FNanchor_705" id="FNanchor_705" href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">705</a></span>.</p>

<p>There is still preserved a short regulation of the 25th May
1537, by the emperor Charles V., respecting bills of exchange
and insurance, in which the strictly fulfilling only of an agreement
of insurance is commanded.</p>

<p>In 1549 the same emperor issued an express order, “Op ’t
faict van der zee-vaerdt,” in which occur some articles respecting
<span class="locked">insurance<a name="FNanchor_706" id="FNanchor_706" href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">706</a></span>, and additions were afterwards made to it
in 1561.</p>

<p>In the year 1556, Philip II., king of Spain, gave to the
Spanish merchants certain regulations respecting insurance,
which are inserted by Magens, with a German translation, in
his work before mentioned. They contain some forms of
policies on ships going to the Indies.</p>

<p>On the last of October 1563, Philip II. published his maritime
laws, in which some forms of policies are <span class="locked">given<a name="FNanchor_707" id="FNanchor_707" href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">707</a></span>; but on
the last of March 1568 that prince forbade the practice of
insurance, on account of the bad use to which it had been
often applied. This prohibition I have not been able to find.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
I am acquainted with it only by an order of the 20th of January
1570, in which the king expressly recals it, because the
merchants at Antwerp, both subjects and foreigners, had presented
strong remonstrances against <span class="locked">it<a name="FNanchor_708" id="FNanchor_708" href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">708</a></span>.</p>

<p>In the year 1598, the Kamer von Assurantie, Chamber of
Insurance, was established at Amsterdam. An account of
the first regulations of this insurance-office may be seen in
Pontanus’s History of the City of Amsterdam, and in other
<span class="locked">works<a name="FNanchor_709" id="FNanchor_709" href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">709</a></span>.</p>

<p>In the year 1600, regulations respecting insurance were
formed by the city of Middelburg in Zealand.</p>

<p>It appears that the first regulations respecting insurances in
England, which may be seen in Anderson’s History of Commerce,
were made in the year 1601. We find by them that
insurers had before that period conducted themselves in such
a manner, that the utmost confidence was reposed in their
honesty, and that on this account few or no disputes had
<span class="locked">arisen<a name="FNanchor_710" id="FNanchor_710" href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">710</a></span>.</p>

<p>In the year 1604, regulations were formed respecting insurance
at Rotterdam; and in 1610 were drawn up those of
Genoa, which Magens has inserted in his work, taken from
the Latin statutes of the Republic, together with a German
translation.</p>

<p>In 1612 the Insurance Chamber at Amsterdam was established
by public authority, and received several privileges.</p>

<p>Malynes asserts, but without either proofs or probability,
that the people of Antwerp were first taught insurance by the
English; and says that, as the merchants assembled for transacting
business in Lombard-street, so called because certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
Italians from Lombardy had <i>lombards</i> there, or houses for
lending money on pledges, long before the building of the
Exchange, it became customary, as it was in his time (1622),
to be guided in policies by what was done in Lombard-street,
in London.</p>

<p>[M‘Culloch <span class="locked">states<a name="FNanchor_711" id="FNanchor_711" href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">711</a></span> that it is probable insurance was introduced
into England some time about the beginning of the sixteenth
century, for it is mentioned in the statute 43 Eliz. c. 12,
in which its utility is very clearly set forth, that it had been
an <i>immemorial usage</i> among merchants, both English and
foreign, when they made any great adventure, to procure insurance
to be made on the ships or goods adventured. From
this it may reasonably be supposed that insurance had been
in use in England for at least a century previous. It appears
from the same statute, that it had originally been usual to refer
all disputes that arose with respect to insurances to the
decision of “grave and discreet” merchants appointed by the
lord mayor. But abuses having grown out of this practice,
the statute authorized the lord chancellor to appoint a commission
for the trial of insurance cases; and in the reign of
Charles II. the powers of the commissioners were enlarged.
But this court soon after fell into disuse; and, what is singular,
no trace can now be discovered of any of its proceedings.]</p>

<p>Guicciardini, who wrote his Account of the Netherlands in
1567, remarks, in describing Antwerp, that the merchants
there were accustomed to insure their ships. Anderson says
that this is the first instance of maritime insurance, which is
very astonishing, as he thinks the invention of insurance is to
be found in Suetonius, and in the laws of the Isle of Oleron.</p>

<p>A most useful imitation of insurance in trade is the institution
of insurance-offices, to indemnify losses sustained by fire.
As far as I have been able to learn, companies for that purpose
were first formed towards the middle of the last century,
though houses were insured by individuals much earlier. The
fire-office at Paris was established in 1745; that of the electorate
of Hanover in 1750; that of Nassau-Weilburg in 1751;
those of Brunswick-Wolfenbuttel and Wirtemberg in 1753;
that of Anspach in 1754; that of Baden-Durlach in 1758;
that of the county of Mark in 1764; those of Saxe-Weimar
and Eisenach in 1768; and that of the Society of the Clergy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
in the Mark of <span class="locked">Brandenburg<a name="FNanchor_712" id="FNanchor_712" href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">712</a></span>, to insure goods and household
furniture, was established in 1769.</p>

<p>It is perhaps known to few, that even in the beginning of
the seventeenth century, a proposal was made by some ingenious
person, that all the proprietors of land should insure the
houses of their subjects against fire, on their paying so much
per cent. annually, according to the value of them. The author
of this scheme presented it to count Anthony Gunther
von Oldenburg, in the year 1609, as a means of finance not to
be found in any work printed on that subject. The author in
his plan <span class="locked">said<a name="FNanchor_713" id="FNanchor_713" href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">713</a></span>, that “as many fires happened by which a great
number of people lost their property, the count might lay before
his subjects the danger of such accidents; and propose to
them, that if they would, either singly or united, put a value
on their houses, and for every hundred dollars valuation pay
to him yearly one dollar; he, on the other hand, would engage,
that in case by the will of God their houses should be
reduced to ashes, the misfortunes of war excepted, he would
take upon himself the loss, and pay to the sufferers as much
money as might be sufficient to rebuild them; and that all
persons, both natives and foreigners, who might be desirous
of sharing in the benefits of this institution, should not be excluded.
The author was confident that, though the damage
might fall heavy at first, a considerable sum would be gradually
raised, from year to year; and that every one might
thus insure his houses against accidents. He had no doubt
that it would be fully proved, if a calculation were made of
the number of houses consumed by fire, within a certain space,
in the course of thirty years, that the loss would not amount,
by a good deal, to the sum that would be collected in that
time. He did not however advise that all the houses in every
town should be comprehended, as the money claimed might
amount to too much; but only that some and certain houses
should be admitted into this association.”</p>

<p>I shall here insert, from the same author, the count’s reflections
on this plan, and the conclusion which he formed:&mdash;“It
is to be considered,” says he, “what sum every proprietor of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
land may with certainty raise and receive; whether the proposed
plan can, to the undoubted benefit of the subjects, and
the advantage of their lord, be honourably, justly, and irreproachfully
instituted without tempting Providence; without
incurring the censure of neighbours; and without disgracing
one’s name and dignity; in the next place, that this institution
may not have the appearance of a scheme to bring money
into the country; and still more that it may have no resemblance
to a duty, tax, or impost, but rather to a free contribution,
or unconstrained remuneration for being insured from
danger, and by which losses being made good, houses can be
sooner rebuilt, and put in their former condition.” The count
allowed that the object of the plan was good, considered in
every point of view, and that a company composed of common
individuals might be formed to insure each other’s houses, and
pay the losses sustained by fire: but he concluded, that, if he
undertook the plan, Providence might be tempted; that his
own subjects might be displeased; and that, improper ideas
being formed of his conduct, he might be accused unjustly of
avarice. “God,” he said, “had without such means preserved
and blessed, for many centuries, the ancient house of Oldenburg;
and he would still be present with him, through his
mercy, and protect his subjects from destructive fires.” He
dismissed, therefore, the ingenious author of this plan, but not
without rewarding him according to his usual liberality.</p>

<p>[Insurance against fire has been known and carried on in
England for nearly a century and a half; at present the number
of British Fire Offices amounts to nearly twenty. The premium
demanded for insurance varies from 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
per £100 according to the supposed risk; the duty is enormous,
being no less than 3<i>s.</i> per cent. on the amount insured. This tax
yields a considerable addition to the revenue; in 1842 it
amounted to £986,420, which corresponds to £563,668,571
value of property insured, leaving out of consideration the
value of insured farming stock, the duty on which was repealed
in the year 1833. On common risks the duty is no less
than 200 per cent. upon the premium! “Such a duty” observes
M‘Culloch, “is in the last degree oppressive and impolitic.
There cannot, in fact, be the slightest doubt that,
were it reduced, as it ought to be, to one-third its present
amount, the business of insurance would be very much extended;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
and as it could not be extended without an increase
of security and without lessening the injurious consequences
arising from the casualties to which property is exposed, the reduction
of the duty would be productive of the best results in
a public point of view; while the increase of business would
prevent the revenue from being materially diminished.” Several
attempts have of late been made in Parliament to induce
the government to lower the amount of duty, hitherto without
success; it is however to be hoped that some other mode of
raising the revenue may be devised than that of taxing so
enormously the prudence of the industrious <span class="locked">classes<a name="FNanchor_714" id="FNanchor_714" href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">714</a></span>.</p>

<p>In addition to the marine and fire insurance, a somewhat
similar speculation has been applied to human life, in the formation
of life-insurance companies. These receive small
annual payments in consideration of securing to the relations
of the assured, or others to whom his property may be bequeathed,
a stipulated sum. This arrangement we consider of
the highest importance in mercantile countries, particularly to
persons engaged in professional or personal occupations, where
on the decease of the principal, the agency or appointment is
not usually susceptible of transfer or bequest. By means of
this species of insurance property is secured to descendants,
who, but for some such precaution, might be left destitute.
The oldest life-assurance office in London is the <i>Amicable</i>.
This company was chartered in 1706, in consequence of
application made to her majesty, Queen Anne, by Sir Thomas
Allen and others. There are now in London nearly eighty
life-assurance companies, of which about sixty are exclusively
devoted to that object, and the remainder unite fire-insurance.
The terms vary in the different offices, although not considerably,
being founded upon recognised sets of tables. A comparative
table of the annual rates of premium charged by each
British office will be found in Waterston’s Cyclopædia of Commerce.
The premium is of course adapted to the probable duration
of life; the lowest being £1 7<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> per £100 on a healthy
life at the entrance age of 15, the highest, at the age of 60, being
about 7 per cent. A diseased condition in most incapacitates
for insurance, but in some offices even diseased lives and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
risks of every kind are insured, of course at a proportional
<span class="locked">rate<a name="FNanchor_715" id="FNanchor_715" href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">715</a></span>.</p>

<p>In the reign of Queen Anne several offices were opened for
making insurances on marriages, births, christenings, service,
&amp;c., and fraudulent practices prevailed to such a degree that
by Stat. 9 Ann. c. 6, § 37, a penalty of £500 is imposed on
every person setting up such office, and £100 for any person
making such assurance in any office already established.</p>

<p>The assurance principle has within the last few years likewise
been applied, with the prospect of success, to the guaranteeing
of fidelity in persons holding situations of trust. In
this case the calculation is, that out of a large range of instances
where individuals of good moral character are entrusted with
sums belonging to their employers, a nearly regular amount
of defalcation will take place annually, or within some other
larger space of time. This may give an unpleasant view of
human nature, but it is found to be a true one, and the question
which arises with men of business is, by what means may
the defalcation be best guarded against. The choice is between
a guarantee from one or two persons, and from a trading
company. By the former plan, the risk is concentrated upon
one or two, who may be deeply injured in consequence: by
the other plan, the risk is not merely diffused, it is <i>extinguished</i>,
for the premiums paid by the insuring parties stand for the
losses, besides affording a profit upon the business. Nor have
we only thus a protection for private parties against the dangers
of security; but individuals, who have the offer of situations
on the condition of giving a sufficient guarantee, may now be
able to take, where formerly they would have had to decline
them, seeing that they might have failed to induce any friend
to venture so far in their behalf. Practically, it has also been
found that, so far from parties being more ready to give way
to temptation when they know that the loss will fall upon a company,
they are less so, seeing that the company exercises a more
rigid supervision, and presents a sterner front to delinquents,
than is the case with private securities in general. Guarantee
companies are now established in London, Edinburgh, Glasgow,
and other large cities. See Chambers’ Tracts, No. 44.]</p>

[M‘Culloch, in his Dictionary of Commerce, art. <i>Insurance</i>, observes respecting
this passage, that “Beckmann seems to have thought that the
practice of insurance originated in Italy, in the latter part of the fifteenth
or the early part of the sixteenth century. But the learned Spanish antiquary,
Don Antonio de Capmany, has given, in his very valuable publication
on the History and Commerce of Barcelona (Memorias Historicas
sobre la Marina, &amp;c., de Barcelona, t. ii. p. 383), an ordinance relative to
insurance, issued by the magistrates of that city in 1435; whereas the earliest
Italian law on the subject is nearly a century later, being dated in
1523. It is however exceedingly unlikely, had insurance been as early
practised in Italy as in Catalonia, that the former should have been so much
behind the latter in subjecting it to any fixed rules; and it is still more
unlikely that the practice should have escaped, as is the case, all mention
by any previous Italian writer. We therefore agree entirely in Capmany’s
opinion, that until some authentic evidence to the contrary be produced,
Barcelona should be regarded as the birth-place of this most useful and
beautiful application of the doctrine of chances.” Had M‘Culloch consulted
the treatise on Bills of Exchange, given in a subsequent part of the
work (vol. iii. p. 430), he would have found that Beckmann, in noticing
the curious memoirs of Capmany, with which he had <i>then</i> become acquainted,
distinctly mentions “An ordinance of the year 1458 respecting
insurance, which required that underwriting should be done in the presence
of a notary, and declared <i>polices o scriptores privades</i> to be null and
void.”]</p></div>

<h2 id="adulteration">ADULTERATION OF WINE.</h2>

<p>No adulteration of any article has ever been invented so pernicious
to the health, and at the same time so much practised,
as that of wine with preparations of lead; and as the inventor
must have been acquainted with its destructive effects, he deserves,
for making it known, severer execration than Berthold
Schwartz, the supposed inventor of gunpowder.</p>

<p>The juice of the grape, when expressed, undergoes what is
termed vinous fermentation and so becomes converted into
wine, but very soon, if great care be not taken, it passes into
a different kind of fermentation, called the acetic; its spirit
then becomes changed into an acid, which renders it unfit to
be drunk, and of much less utility. The progress of the fermentation
may be stopped by care and attention; but to bring
the liquor back to its former state is impossible. Ingenuity,
however, has invented a fraudulent method of rendering the
acid in spoilt wine imperceptible; so that those who are not
judges are often imposed on, and purchase sweetened vinegar
instead of wine. Were no other articles used for sweetening
it than honey or sugar, the adulterator would deserve no severer
punishment than those who sell pinchbeck for gold; but
saccharine juices can be used only when the liquor begins to
turn sour; and even then in very small quantities, else it would
betray the imposition by its sweetish-sour taste, and hasten
that change which it is intended to prevent. A sweetener
therefore, has been invented much surer for the fraudulent
dealer, but infinitely more destructive to the consumer; and
those who employ it, undoubtedly, merit the same punishment
as the most infamous poisoners.</p>

<p>Lead and its oxide or carbonate, dissolved in the acid which
spoils wine, give it a saccharine taste not unpleasant, without
any new, or at least perceptible tint, and arrest the progress
of the acid fermentation. The wine, however, occasions,
according as it is used in a great or small quantity, and according
to the constitution of the consumer, a speedy or lingering
death, violent colics, obstructions and other maladies; so that
one may justly doubt whether, at present, Mars, Venus, or
Saturn is most destructive to the human race.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
The ancients, in my opinion, knew that lead rendered harsh
wine milder, and preserved it from acidity, without being
aware that it was poisonous. It was therefore long used
with confidence; and when its effects were discovered they
were not ascribed to the metal, but to some other cause.
When more accurate observation, in modern times, fully
established the noxious property of lead, and when it began to
be dreaded in wine, unprincipled dealers invented an artful
method of employing it, which the law, by the severest punishment,
was not able wholly to prevent.</p>

<p>The Greeks and the Romans were accustomed to boil their
wine over a slow fire, till only a half, third, or fourth part remained,
and to mix it with bad wine in order to improve it.
When, by this operation, it had lost part of its watery particles,
and had been mixed with honey and spices, it acquired several
names, such as <i>mustum</i>, <i>mulsum</i>, <i>sapa</i>, <i>carenum</i>, or <i>caroenum</i>,
<i>defrutum</i><a name="FNanchor_716" id="FNanchor_716" href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">716</a>, &amp;c. Even at present the same method is pursued
with sack, Spanish, Hungarian, and Italian wines. In Italy,
new wine, which has been thus boiled, is put into flasks, and
used for salad and sauces. In Naples it is called <i>musto cotto</i>;
but in Florence it still retains the name of <i>sapa</i>. Most of
those authors who have described this method of boiling wine
expressly say that leaden or tin vessels must be employed; because
the wine, by these, is rendered more delicious and durable,
as well as clearer. It is, however, certain that must and
sour wine by slow boiling, for according to their directions it
should not be boiled quickly, must dissolve part of these dangerous
metals, otherwise the desired effect could not be <span class="locked">produced<a name="FNanchor_717" id="FNanchor_717" href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">717</a></span>.
Some also were accustomed to add to their wine, before it was
boiled, a certain quantity of sea water, which by its saline
particles would necessarily accelerate the <span class="locked">solution<a name="FNanchor_718" id="FNanchor_718" href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">718</a></span>.</p>

<p>That the acid of wine has the power of dissolving lead was
not unknown to the ancients; for when the Greek and Roman
wine-merchants wished to try whether their wine was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
spoiled, they immersed in it a plate of <span class="locked">lead<a name="FNanchor_719" id="FNanchor_719" href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">719</a></span>. If the colour of
the lead was changed, which undoubtedly would be the case
when its surface was corroded, they concluded that their wine
was spoiled. It cannot, however, be said that they were altogether
ignorant of the dangerous effects of solutions of that
metal; for Galen and other physicians often give cautions respecting
white lead. Notwithstanding this, men fell upon the
invention of conveying water for culinary purposes in leaden
<span class="locked">pipes<a name="FNanchor_720" id="FNanchor_720" href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">720</a></span>; and even at present at London, Amsterdam, Paris, and
other places water is conveyed through lead, and collected in
leaden cisterns, though that practice has, on several occasions,
been attended with alarming <span class="locked">consequences<a name="FNanchor_721" id="FNanchor_721" href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">721</a></span>. This negligence
in modern times makes us not be surprised when we read that
the ancients employed leaden vessels. It appears, however,
that it was not merely through negligence that this practice
prevailed. They were acquainted, and particularly in Pliny’s
time, with various processes used in regard to <span class="locked">wine<a name="FNanchor_722" id="FNanchor_722" href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">722</a></span>; and
among these was that of boiling it with lime or <span class="locked">gypsum<a name="FNanchor_723" id="FNanchor_723" href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">723</a></span>; and
the ancient physicians, who had not the assistance of our modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
chemistry, thought it more probable that their wine was
rendered noxious by the addition of these <span class="locked">earths<a name="FNanchor_724" id="FNanchor_724" href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">724</a></span>, than by the
vessels in which it was boiled; and they were the more inclined
to this opinion, as they had instances of the fatal effects
produced by the use of <span class="locked">them<a name="FNanchor_725" id="FNanchor_725" href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">725</a></span>. They decried them, therefore,
so much, that laws were afterwards made by which they were
forbidden to be used, as poisonous and destructive to the human
body.</p>

<p>Wine which has once begun to spoil cannot be perfectly
restored by lime; for it cannot bring back to it the spirituous
part which it has lost, neither can it remove the acid with
which it is incorporated; but it can render it imperceptible
to the tongue by uniting with it, and forming an earthy salt
of an almost insipid taste. This method of improving sour
wine is still practised in the island of <span class="locked">Zante<a name="FNanchor_726" id="FNanchor_726" href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">726</a></span>, in <span class="locked">Spain<a name="FNanchor_727" id="FNanchor_727" href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">727</a></span>, on
the coast of <span class="locked">Africa<a name="FNanchor_728" id="FNanchor_728" href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">728</a></span>, and in many other countries. It is,
however, condemned by several physicians and chemists; because
obstructions and other bad effects are to be apprehended
from it. Some, on the contrary, consider it as <span class="locked">harmless<a name="FNanchor_729" id="FNanchor_729" href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">729</a></span>;
and I must confess that I should expect no bad consequences
from such a small quantity of lime as would be necessary for
that purpose. It will produce a salt which will have the same
effects as that tartareous crust called wine-stone, and will act
as a laxative, like the salts which our apothecaries prepare
from that calcareous stone crab’s-eyes, by means of vinegar
or lemon-juice. The lime, which the acid of the wine cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
dissolve, will fall to the bottom as a sediment, and assist to
clarify the wine. Used however in too great quantity, it may
hasten the destruction of the still remaining spirituous part,
and render the wine weak; a caution which has been given
to wine-merchants by Neumann.</p>

<p>Gypsum is a compound of sulphuric acid with lime, and
were it always pure, its effects upon wine would be imperceptible;
but as the most kinds of common gypsum contain
abundance of carbonate of lime, they effervesce with acids,
are dissolved in part by them, and form that salt which I have
before said I consider as harmless. By means of this carbonate
gypsum improves sour wine, as well as common wine.
I took half an ounce of that gypsum which at Osterode is
pounded and used as mortar, and which is hard, white, and
shining, and almost of the nature of alabaster. When I had
pounded it, I put it into strong vinegar in a glass vessel, and
suffered it to boil for a few minutes. I then strained it
through filtering-paper; and what remained, after it was
washed and dried, weighed 215 grains; so that the vinegar
had dissolved 25 grains, which were precipitated afterwards
by carbonated alkali. I pursued the like process with half an
ounce of burnt gypsum, such as is used here for floors; and I
found that two ounces of the same vinegar dissolved half a
drachm of it, which was somewhat more in proportion than of
the former. Every one whom I caused to taste of this vinegar
remarked that both had lost a considerable share of their acidity;
but that the vinegar which had been boiled with burnt
gypsum had lost the most. Few kinds of native gypsum are
perfectly pure; and at any rate we have no reason to suppose
that the ancients sought pure gypsum for their wines. This
method is not yet disused. We are told by Arvieux, that it
is still employed in the island of Milo; and I shall here take
occasion to observe that salt water also is added to wine there,
even at present. Christopher Vega, whom I have before
quoted, reproaches the Spaniards with the use of gypsum;
and it has been condemned by the modern as well as the ancient
physicians. An Englishman of the name of Hardy seems
to suspect that gypsum contains lead and arsenical <span class="locked">earth<a name="FNanchor_730" id="FNanchor_730" href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">730</a></span>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
but it appears that this writer doubted whether our gypsum
be the same as that of the ancients; and indeed it is necessary,
before we use their information respecting natural objects,
to examine carefully whether they understood by any
name what we understand by it; and what they meant by
gypsum has been determined neither by Stephanus, Ferber,
nor Gesner. We however know this much, that the ancients
burnt their gypsum, and that they formed and cast images of
<span class="locked">it<a name="FNanchor_731" id="FNanchor_731" href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">731</a></span>. In my opinion wine cannot be poisoned by gypsum; and
wine-merchants who employ it and lime deserve no severer
punishment than brewers, who, in the like manner, render sour
beer fitter to be drunk and more saleable.</p>

<p>That the ancients were accustomed to clarify their wine
with gypsum, is proved by different passages of the Greek
writers on husbandry. They threw gypsum into their new
wine; stirred it often round, then let it stand for some time,
and, when it had settled, poured off the clear <span class="locked">liquor<a name="FNanchor_732" id="FNanchor_732" href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">732</a></span>. It
would, however, appear that they had remarked that gypsum
caused the spirituous part to disappear; for we read that the
wine acquired by it a certain sharpness which it afterwards
lost, but that the good effects of the gypsum were <span class="locked">lasting<a name="FNanchor_733" id="FNanchor_733" href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">733</a></span>.
This process in modern times has been publicly forbidden, in
many countries, as it was in Spain in the year 1348.</p>

<p>Calcined shells were in ancient times used instead of <span class="locked">lime<a name="FNanchor_734" id="FNanchor_734" href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">734</a></span>.
Potters-earth was also thrown into wine, in order to clarify it
by carrying the muddy particles with it to the bottom. This
method I have seen employed in the breweries at Amsterdam,
to purify the water. In the south of France it is used for
clarifying wine-stone ley; and in my opinion it might be
useful on many other <span class="locked">occasions<a name="FNanchor_735" id="FNanchor_735" href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">735</a></span>.</p>

<p>The ancients poisoned their wine with lead without knowing
it; but at what period did that pernicious practice begin
of employing sugar of lead and litharge? Litharge was not
unknown to the ancients; for it is mentioned by Dioscorides,
Aëtius, and others. Sugar of lead is, indeed, more modern;
but I have found no information respecting the invention of
it, except that it was known to Paracelsus, who died in 1541,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
and who ventured to prescribe it for some disorders. It was
known also to Angelus Sala, one of the most ingenious of the
early chemists. In the Roman laws no particular orders occur
against the adulteration or poisoning of wine; for what we
read in the <span class="locked">Institutiones<a name="FNanchor_736" id="FNanchor_736" href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">736</a></span> is applicable only to the spoiling of
another person’s wine, and thereby occasioning a loss to him;
and this explanation is confirmed by the <span class="locked">Digesta<a name="FNanchor_737" id="FNanchor_737" href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">737</a></span>. The German
prohibitions against the adulteration of wine began in the
fifteenth century, and were from time to time renewed with
additional severity. In that century, we find complaints
against this practice with lime, sulphur, and milk; but no instance
occurs of the poisoning with lead. I however conjecture
that the use of litharge was introduced in the twelfth or
thirteenth century; but the framers of the laws were not acquainted
with the real poison; and instead of causing it to be
examined by the chemists, who it must be confessed had not
advanced far in their art, they contented themselves with prohibiting
the use of those things which they found considered
by the ancients as dangerous.</p>

<p>Among the oldest German prohibitions against the adulteration
of wine is that of Nuremberg in the year 1409; in which
however there is no notice taken of litharge. Another of the
year 1475 is mentioned by <span class="locked">Datt<a name="FNanchor_738" id="FNanchor_738" href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">738</a></span>; but some Imperial ones of
an earlier period may have been <span class="locked">lost<a name="FNanchor_739" id="FNanchor_739" href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">739</a></span>. In the year 1487 the
emperor caused an order against the adulteration of wine to be
published by the governments in Swabia, Franconia and Alsace;
and this practice was a subject of deliberation at the diet of
Rothenburg the same year, and also at the diet of Worms,
under Maximilian I., in 1495. At the diet of Lindau the use
of sulphur was in particular prohibited, and also at Freyburg
in Brisgau in 1498. In the year 1500 the same affair was
discussed at Augsburg, and again at that city in 1548, under
Charles V. It appears that this business was left afterwards
to the care of the different princes, who from time to time
issued prohibitions against so destructive a fraud.</p>

<p>Older and severer prohibitions are however to be found in
other countries. By an order of William count of Hennegau,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
Holland and Zeeland, of the year 1327, we find that long before
that period it was customary to adulterate wine with noxious
and dangerous substances. In the year 1384 the government
at Brussels issued a severer order of the like kind, in which
vitriol, quicksilver and lapis calaminaris are <span class="locked">mentioned<a name="FNanchor_740" id="FNanchor_740" href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">740</a></span>. In
France we find an old <i>ordonnance du prevôt de Paris</i>, for the
same purpose, dated September the 20th and December the
2nd, 1371, in which no minerals are mentioned; but in that of
1696 litharge is particularly <span class="locked">noticed<a name="FNanchor_741" id="FNanchor_741" href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">741</a></span>.</p>

<p>Conrade Celtes, who in the year 1491 was first crowned in
Germany as a poet, gives in his panegyric on Nuremberg some
information respecting the adulteration of wine, from which
we learn that he considered it as a new invention, and ascribed
it to a monk called Martin Bayr; but his expressions are so
figurative, that little can be gathered from <span class="locked">them<a name="FNanchor_742" id="FNanchor_742" href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor">742</a></span>. We are
however told by Zeller, that it was believed that this dangerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
fraud was invented in <span class="locked">France<a name="FNanchor_743" id="FNanchor_743" href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor">743</a></span>. Martin Zeiler, in his Chronicle
of Swabia (p. 65), says, “In the year 1453, the citizens
of Augsburg began to observe this fraud in the wine-market;
for during four years before, Martin Bayr, at Schwarzen-Eychen
in Franconia, first taught the German tavern-keepers
and the waggoners to preserve new wine from becoming sour;
to clarify wine by sulphur; and likewise to counterfeit it by
spices, to the great prejudice of people’s health.” In this passage
there is no mention of litharge, but of other mixtures.
The oldest account of the poisonous sweetening of wine is that
which occurs in the French ordinance of <span class="locked">1696<a name="FNanchor_744" id="FNanchor_744" href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor">744</a></span>; and Zeller’s
conjecture that it was invented or first remarked in France,
seems to me the more probable, as it appears that it was practised
at Wurtemberg about the same period. In the year
1697 it was known there that some wine-merchants, particularly
Hans George Staltser at Goppingen, used litharge for
refining wine, and by these means deprived many persons of
life, and occasioned the loss of health to others. Staltser
pleaded in excuse, that he considered the process he had employed
as harmless, and that Masskosky, physician to the town
of Goppingen, who was accounted a man of knowledge, had
employed the same for his wine. Brugel also, physician to
the town of Heidenheim, had declared that litharge was not
prejudicial; and as he was a person of reputation, his opinion
had tended not a little to establish the use of that practice.
This report was so hurtful to the wine-trade of Wurtemberg,
which at that time brought a great deal of money into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
duchy from other countries, that the wine at Ulm remained
unsold; and duke Everhard Louis was obliged to cause experiments
to be made to ascertain the nature of the substances
mixed with it. Solomon Keysel, the duke’s physician, and
J. Gaspar Harlin, physician to the court, both declared that
litharge was noxious, but that sulphur besprinkled with bismuth
was still more so. They strongly advised, therefore, that
both these substances should be forbidden to be used, under
the heaviest penalties; and this prohibition was put in force
with the greater severity as some persons of the first rank had
for several years before caused their spoiled and sour wine to
be made sweet and clear in this manner by a weaver of Pforzheim,
who resided at Stutgart. An order was issued on the
10th of May 1697, forbidding this adulteration under pain of
death and confiscation of property, as well as of being declared
infamous; and the duke requested the neighbouring states,
particularly Bavaria and Eychstat, to keep a more watchful
eye over their wine-merchants and waggoners, by which means
it was supposed all danger would be avoided.</p>

<p>In the following year, the city of Ulm discovered a poor
man at Giengen, within its own jurisdiction, who had sweetened
with litharge some sour wine purchased at Wurtemberg. He
was accordingly banished from the country; and several other
persons in the duchy were condemned to labour at the fortifications.
This example was attended with so good an effect,
that for some time adulteration was not heard of; but eight
years after, John Jacob Ehrni of Eslingen introduced that
practice again with some variation, and not only employed it
himself, but induced others to follow it in several other places.
Greater severity was at length exercised. Ehrni was beheaded;
the possessors of adulterated wine were fined, and the wine
was thrown away. After this second example, which was followed
in other parts of the country, the art of adulterating
wine seems to have been more carefully concealed, or to have
been entirely abandoned. But in the present century treatises
have been published on the management of wine, in which the
art of improving it by litharge has been taught, as a method

<p>For detecting metal in wine, the arsenical liver of sulphur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
is commonly employed; a solution of which is called <i>liquor
probatorius Wurtembergicus</i><a name="FNanchor_746" id="FNanchor_746" href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor">746</a>. This appellation, in my opinion,
has been given to it because it was first applied for that
purpose by a public order in the duchy of Wurtemberg;
though the invention is ascribed to one of the duke’s <span class="locked">physicians<a name="FNanchor_747" id="FNanchor_747" href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">747</a></span>.
The use of it however is not attended with certainty,
because it precipitates several metals black without distinction,
and lead is not the only one that we have reason to suspect in
wine.</p>

<p>The operation of fumigating wine with sulphur is performed
by kindling rags of linen dipped in melted brimstone, and suffering
the vapour to enter a cask filled, or partly filled, with
that liquor. I do not know at what period this process was
invented; but it is worthy of remark, that we are told by
<span class="locked">Pliny<a name="FNanchor_748" id="FNanchor_748" href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">748</a></span>, that in his time some employed sulphur in the preparation
of wine. On this subject he quotes Cato; but the
passage to which he alludes is not to be found in the works of
that author handed down to us; and the method in which it
was really used is consequently unknown. Reason and experience
show that the vapour of sulphur stops the fermentation
so hurtful to wine, and prevents it from spoiling; and many
writers on the management of wine allow the free use of it for
that <span class="locked">purpose<a name="FNanchor_749" id="FNanchor_749" href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">749</a></span>. It can certainly do no injury to the health;
and it was not necessary for the police in different countries
to distribute prescriptions for employing it, to forbid it, or to
limit the <span class="locked">quantity<a name="FNanchor_750" id="FNanchor_750" href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">750</a></span>.</p>

<p>Some wine-dealers are accustomed to sprinkle over with
bismuth the rags dipped in sulphur used for fumigating wine,
and this addition is a German <span class="locked">invention<a name="FNanchor_751" id="FNanchor_751" href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor">751</a></span>. It has been severely
forbidden by express laws; and there are undoubtedly sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
grounds for its being reprobated. At any rate this metallic
addition is of no use in any point of view, as the most
experienced dealers in wine have long since acknowledged.</p>

<p>In an old Imperial ordinance, milk also is mentioned as an
article used in the adulterating of wine. This method was
known to and practised by the ancient <span class="locked">Grecians<a name="FNanchor_752" id="FNanchor_752" href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">752</a></span>. But in the
opinion of Von Rohr milk cannot be employed for that <span class="locked">purpose<a name="FNanchor_753" id="FNanchor_753" href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">753</a></span>.
“One can scarcely comprehend,” says he, “how the
framers of laws should ever imagine that a wine-dealer would
be so simple as to adulterate wine with milk; and those who
do so, deserve not to be punished for their folly. As they will
find no purchasers to wine adulterated by so strange a mixture,
that punishment will be sufficient.” The effects of milk however
may be easily comprehended. It causes the wine to throw
up a scum, which carries with it every impurity; and this
being taken off along with it, the wine must of course be rendered
much clearer. However, though this mixture cannot
be called an adulteration, it is certain that wine may be refined
much better by isinglass, and that method is followed at
present.</p>

<p>I shall observe in the last place, that in the year 1472, Stum-wine,
as it is called, was prohibited as a bad liquor prejudicial
to the <span class="locked">health<a name="FNanchor_754" id="FNanchor_754" href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">754</a></span>. By this term is understood wine, the fermentation
of which has been checked, and which on that account
continues sweet; seldom becomes clear; and, even when it
clarifies, turns muddy when exposed to the air, because the
fermentation, which has been stopped, again <span class="locked">commences<a name="FNanchor_755" id="FNanchor_755" href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">755</a></span>.
Wines of this kind are allowed at present. They are called
<i>vina muta</i> or <i>suffocata</i>, and have a great resemblance to a sort
of wine made principally at Bordeaux, to which the French
give the name of <i>vin en rage</i>.</p>

<p>[In no country of the world has the adulteration and brewing
of wines attained to such a pitch of perfection as in this “tight
little island.” So impudently and notoriously are these frauds
practised, and so boldly are they avowed, that there are books<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
published called ‘Publican’s Guides’ and ‘Licensed Victuallers’
Directors,’ in which the most infamous receipts imaginable
are laid down to swindle their <span class="locked">customers<a name="FNanchor_756" id="FNanchor_756" href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor">756</a></span>. One of these
recommends port wine to be manufactured, after sulphuring
a cask, with twelve gallons of strong port; six of rectified
spirit; three of cognac brandy; forty-two of fine rough cider;
making sixty-three gallons, which cost about eighteen shillings
a dozen. Another receipt is forty-five gallons of cider; six of
brandy; eight of port wine; two gallons of sloes stewed in two
gallons of water, and the liquor pressed off. If the colour is
not good, tincture of red sanders or cudbear is directed to be
added. This may be bottled in a few days, and a tea-spoonful
of powder of catechu being added to each, a fine crusted
appearance on the bottles will quickly follow. The ends of
the corks being soaked in a strong decoction of brazil-wood
and a little alum, will complete this interesting process, and
give them the appearance of age. Oak-bark, elder, brazil-wood,
privet, beet, turnsole, are all used in making fictitious
port wine.</p>

<p>The wines of Madeira are in like manner adulterated or wholly
manufactured in England, which from these devices may justly
claim the title of a universal wine country, where every species
is made if it be not grown. The basis of the adulteration
of madeira is vidonia, mingled with a little port, mountain,
and cape, sugar-candy and bitter-almonds, and the colour
made lighter or deepened to the proper shade, as the case may
require. Even vidonia itself is adulterated with cider, rum,
and carbonate of soda to correct acidity. Bucellas, cape, in
short every species of wine that it is worth while to imitate,
is adulterated or manufactured in this country with cheaper
substances. Common Sicilian wine has been metamorphosed
so as to pass for tokay and lachryma christi; even cape wine
itself has been imitated by liquids, if possible inferior to the
genuine article.</p>

<p>Gooseberry wine is often passed off for champagne; the very
bottles are bought up for the purpose of filling with gooseberry
wine, and are then corked to resemble champagne. It has also
been made from white and raw sugar, citric or tartaric acid,
water, home-made grape wine or perry and French brandy&mdash;cochineal
or strawberries have been added to imitate the pink.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
In fact vegetation has been exhausted, and the bowels of the
earth ransacked to supply trash for this most vicious practice.</p>

<p>Redding observes, in his valuable and most interesting work
on the History and Description of Modern Wines, that the
clumsy attempts at wine-brewing made a century ago would
be scorned by a modern adept. It is said that when George
the Fourth was in the “high and palmy” days of early dissipation,
he possessed a very small quantity of remarkably choice
and scarce wine. The gentlemen of his suite, whose taste was
hardly second to their master’s, finding it had not been demanded,
thought it was forgotten, and, relishing its virtues,
exhausted it almost to the last bottle, when they were surprised
by the unexpected command that the wine should be
forthcoming at an entertainment on the following day. Consternation
was visible on their faces; a hope of escaping
discovery hardly existed, when one of them, as a last
resource, went off in haste to a noted wine-brewer in the city,
numbered among his acquaintance, and related his dilemma.
“Have you any of the wine left for a specimen?” said the
adept; “O yes, there are a couple of bottles.” “Well then,
send me one, and I will forward the necessary quantity in time;
only tell me the latest moment it can be received, for it must
be drunk immediately.” The wine was sent, the deception
answered; the princely hilarity was disturbed by no discovery
of the fictitious potation, and the manufacturer was thought a
very clever fellow by his friends. What would Sir Richard
Steele have said to so neat an imitation, when in his day he
complains that sinister fabrications were coarsely managed
with sloe-juice? the science of adulteration must then have
been in its infancy.]</p>

of the very general use of leaden pipes and cisterns lined with this metal.
From the researches of Lieut.-Col. Yorke, published in the Philosophical
Magazine for August 1834 and January 1846, it would appear that a bright
leaden vessel containing pure water, such as distilled water, and <i>exposed to
the air</i>, soon becomes oxidized and corroded; oxide of lead being readily
detected <i>in solution</i> by means of sulphuretted hydrogen and other sensitive
tests; but river and spring water exert a much less or no such solvent
power, the carbonates and sulphates in such water preventing it. It is
on this account that leaden vessels are used with such impunity, the crust
which forms upon the metal entirely preventing all further action. However,
as this crust consists partially of carbonate of lead, which is a very
dangerous poison, great care should be taken on cleaning or scraping such
cisterns to avoid using the water in which particles of the salt may have
become diffused. Leaden cisterns are sometimes rendered unsafe in
consequence of iron or zinc pipes being soldered or let into them, thus
giving rise to galvanic action, which greatly facilitates the solution of the
lead.]</p></div>

for this execrable fraud, as well as many more deceptions, has been
invented in the present age; and a villany by which the colour, taste,
smell and substance of wine are so changed as to resemble that of another
country, has been spread not only through Germany, but also through
France, Hungary and other kingdoms. It was invented, they say, by a
monk named Martin Bayr, of Schwarzen-Eychen in Franconia. He undoubtedly
merits eternal damnation for rendering noxious and destructive
a liquor used for sacred purposes, and most agreeable to the human body;
thus contaminating and debasing a gift of nature inferior to none called
forth from the bosom of the earth by the influence of the solar rays; and
for converting, like a sanguinary destroyer of the human race, that bestowed
upon us by Nature to promote mirth and joy, and as a soother of
our cares, into a poison and the cause of various distempers. But if the
debasers of the current coin are punished capitally, what punishment ought
to be inflicted upon the person who hath either killed or thrown into diseases
all those who used wine? The former by their fraud injure a few,
but the latter exposes to various dangers people of all ages, and of both
sexes; occasions barrenness in women; brings on abortions and makes
them miscarry; corrupts and dries up the milk of nurses; excites gouty
pains in the body; causes others in the bowels and reins, than which none
can be more excruciating; and produces ulcers in the intestines; in short,
his poison inflames, corrodes, burns, extenuates, and dries up; nor does it
allay, but increase thirst; for such is the nature of sulphur, which, mixed
with other noxious and poisonous things, the names of which I should be
ashamed to mention, is added to wine, before it has done fermenting, in
order to change its nature. This poison we have been obliged to purchase
for our friends, wives, children and selves, at a high price; as wine has
been scarce for several years past; and it would seem that Nature had denied
this liquor so long out of revenge against her enemies and the destroyers
of the whole human race. You ought, therefore, most prudent fathers,
not only to empty their vessels, by throwing this poison into your river;

poisoning as well as robbery.”&mdash;Pirkheimeri Opera, Franck. 1610, fol.

kinds of <span class="locked">shell-fish<a name="FNanchor_758" id="FNanchor_758" href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor">758</a></span>, have been much used as ornaments since

<span class="locked">collected<a name="FNanchor_761" id="FNanchor_761" href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor">761</a></span>. By the increase of luxury among the European<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
nations, the use of pearls has become more common; and even
in Pliny’s time they were worn by the wives of the inferior
public officers, in order that they might vie in the costliness
of their dress with ladies of the first rank. It is probable,
therefore, that methods were early invented to occasion or
hasten the formation of pearls; and as at present those who
cannot afford to purchase gold, jewels, and porcelain, use in
their stead pinchbeck, artificial gems, and stone-ware, so
methods were fallen upon to make artificial pearls.</p>

<p>The art of forcing shell-fish to produce pearls was known,
in the first centuries of the christian æra to the inhabitants of
the coasts of the Red-sea, as we are told by the philosopher
Apollonius, who thought that circumstance worthy of particular
notice. The Indians dived into the sea, after they had rendered
it calm and more transparent by pouring oil into it. They
then enticed the fish by means of some bait to open their
shells; and having pricked them with a sharp pointed instrument,
received the liquor that flowed from them in small holes
made in an iron vessel, in which they hardened into real <span class="locked">pearls<a name="FNanchor_762" id="FNanchor_762" href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">762</a></span>.
Olearius says that this account is to be found in no other
author: but it has at least been copied by <span class="locked">Tzetzes<a name="FNanchor_763" id="FNanchor_763" href="#Footnote_763" class="fnanchor">763</a></span>.</p>

<p>We are as yet too little acquainted with shell-fish to be able
to determine with certainty how much truth there really may
be in this relation: but there is great reason to conjecture from
it that the people who lived on the borders of the Red-sea
were then acquainted with a method of forcing shell-fish to
produce pearls; and as the arts in general of the ancient Indians
have been preserved without much variation, the process
employed by the Chinese at present, to cause a certain kind
of mussels to form pearls, seems to confirm the account given
by Philostratus. In the beginning of summer, at the time
when the mussels repair to the surface of the water and open
their shells, five or six small beads, made of mother-of-pearl,
and strung on a thread, are thrown into each of them. At
the end of a year, when the mussels are drawn up and opened,
the beads are found covered with a pearly crust, in such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
manner that they have a perfect resemblance to real pearls.
The truth of this information cannot be doubted, though some
experiments made in Bohemia for the same purpose were not
attended with <span class="locked">success<a name="FNanchor_764" id="FNanchor_764" href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor">764</a></span>. It has been confirmed by various
<span class="locked">persons<a name="FNanchor_765" id="FNanchor_765" href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">765</a></span>, and it is very probable that some operations and
secrets, without which the process would prove fruitless even
in China, may be unknown to the Europeans. Besides, many
observations are known which seem to show the possibility of
such an effect being produced. Fabricius says that he saw
in the possession of Sir Joseph Banks, at London, large <i>Chamæ</i><a name="FNanchor_766" id="FNanchor_766" href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor">766</a>,
brought from China, in which there were several bits of
iron wire, incrusted with a substance of a perfect pearly <span class="locked">nature<a name="FNanchor_767" id="FNanchor_767" href="#Footnote_767" class="fnanchor">767</a></span>.
These bits of wire, he said, had been sharp, and it appeared
as if the mussels, to secure themselves against the points of the
wire, had covered them with this substance, by which means
they had been rendered blunt. May not therefore the process
employed by the ancients be still practised? And may not
these bits of wire have been the same as those spikes used by
the people in the neighbourhood of the Red-sea for pricking
mussels, and which perhaps slipped from the hands of the
Chinese workmen and remained in the animals?</p>

<p>The invention therefore of Linnæus cannot be called altogether
new. That great man informed the king and council
in the year 1761, that he had discovered an art by which
mussels might be made to produce pearls, and he offered to
disclose the method for the benefit of the kingdom. This
however was not done, but he disposed of his secret to one
Bagge, a merchant at Gottenburg, for the sum of eighteen
thousand copper dollars, which make about five hundred ducats.
In the year 1780, the heirs of this merchant wished to
sell to the highest bidder the sealed-up <span class="locked">receipt<a name="FNanchor_768" id="FNanchor_768" href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor">768</a></span>: but whether
the paper was purchased, or who bought it, I do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
know; for Professor Retzius at Lund, of whom I inquired respecting
it, could not inform <span class="locked">me<a name="FNanchor_769" id="FNanchor_769" href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor">769</a></span>. In the year 1763, it was
said in the German newspapers, that Linnæus was ennobled
on account of this discovery, and that he bore a pearl in his
coat of arms; but both these assertions are false, though Fabricius
conjectures that the first may be <span class="locked">true<a name="FNanchor_770" id="FNanchor_770" href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor">770</a></span>. Linnæus received
his patent of nobility, which, together with his arms, I
have seen, in the year 1756, consequently long before he said
anything respecting that discovery, of which the patent does
not make the least mention. What in his arms has been
taken for a pearl, is an egg, by which M. Tilas, whose business
it then was to blazon the arms of ennobled families,
meant to represent all nature, after the manner of the ancient
Egyptians. The arms are divided into three fields, each of
which, by the colour forming the ground, expresses one of
the kingdoms of nature; the red signifying the animal, and
the green the vegetable, &amp;c. Over the helmet, by way of
crest, is placed the <i>Linnæa</i><a name="FNanchor_771" id="FNanchor_771" href="#Footnote_771" class="fnanchor">771</a>; that beautiful little moth the
<i>Phalæna linneella</i>, shining with its silvery colours, is displayed
around the border instead of festoons; and below is
the following motto, <i>Famam extendere factis</i>. Linnæus once
showed me, among his collection of shells, a small box filled
with pearl, and said, “Hos uniones confeci artificio meo; sunt
tantum quinque annorum, et tamen tam magni.” “These
pearls I made by my art, and though so large they are only
five years old.” They were deposited near the <i>Unio margaritifera</i>,
from which most of the Swedish pearls are procured;
and the son, who was however not acquainted with his father’s
secret, said the experiments were made only on this kind of
mussel, though Linnæus himself assured me that they would
succeed on all kinds.</p>

<p>I conjecture that Linnæus alluded to this art in his writings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
so early as the year 1746, or long before he ever thought of
keeping it a secret. The passage I mean is in the sixth edition
of his Systema Naturæ, where he says, “Margarita.
Testæ excrescentia latere interiore, dum exterius latus <span class="locked">perforatur<a name="FNanchor_772" id="FNanchor_772" href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor">772</a></span>.”
I once told him that I had discovered his secret
in his own works; but he seemed to be displeased, did not
inquire after the passage, and changed the discourse. That
pearls are produced when the shells have been pierced or injured
in a certain manner, is highly probable, and has been
in modern times often <span class="locked">remarked<a name="FNanchor_773" id="FNanchor_773" href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor">773</a></span>. It appears also, that the
animal has the power of sometimes filling up such openings
with a calcareous substance, which it deposits in them. This
substance assumes the figure of the orifice, and the animal
particles it contains give it its brightness and <span class="locked">lustre<a name="FNanchor_774" id="FNanchor_774" href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor">774</a></span>. Pearl-fishers
have long known that mussels, the shells of which are
rough and irregular, or which exhibit marks of violence,
commonly contain pearls, though they are found also in others
in which the same appearances are not <span class="locked">observed<a name="FNanchor_775" id="FNanchor_775" href="#Footnote_775" class="fnanchor">775</a></span>. I am perfectly
aware that some experiments made by piercing the
shells of mussels, have been <span class="locked">unsuccessful<a name="FNanchor_776" id="FNanchor_776" href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor">776</a></span>; but this does not
prove that it is impossible to procure pearls in that manner.
Those who made them did not perhaps pierce the proper part
of the shell; perhaps they made the orifice so large that it
weakened the animal; and they may not have chosen the
fittest season of the year. The strongest objection however
which can be made on this subject, is the undeniable truth
that the proper valuable pearls are not found adhering to the
shell, but in the body only; and that therefore those calcareous
balls which fill up holes, cannot be perfect pearls. But
from the words of Linnæus above-quoted, I am led to conjecture,
that he only made a hole in the shell without piercing it
quite through. Linnæus also may have done some injury to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
the animal itself when it opened its shell; for it is certain
that testaceous animals are strong-lived, and can easily sustain
any violence. It appears by the Transactions of the Swedish
Academy, that some have been of opinion that shell-fish
might be made to produce pearls by a particular kind of nourishment;
and <span class="locked">Lister<a name="FNanchor_777" id="FNanchor_777" href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor">777</a></span> thinks that these excrescences would be
more abundant, were the mussels placed in water impregnated
with calcareous matter; but Professor Linnæus seems certain
that his father employed none of these methods.</p>

<p>Under the name of false or artificial pearls are understood
at present small beads, so prepared by art as to approach very
near to real pearls in shape, lustre, colour, and polish. It appears
that in Pliny’s time such were not known, else he certainly
would have mentioned them. The invention was not
easy, and this difficulty to imitate pearls has contributed,
with the reasons before mentioned, to keep up their value.
It would seem that at first, hopes were entertained of finding
a method to make large pearls from small or broken ones.
Tzetzes speaks of this imagined art, and receipts for that
purpose have been still retained in various books, where they
fill up room and amuse the ignorant; for it is hardly possible
to give to the pulverised calcareous matter sufficient hardness,
and that lustre which belongs only to the surface of real
pearls, and which, when these are destroyed, is irrecoverably
lost. More ingenious was the idea of making pearl-coloured
glass beads of that kind called <i>margaritini</i><a name="FNanchor_778" id="FNanchor_778" href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor">778</a>; but it excites
no wonder that this was not done earlier, although the art of
making coloured glass is very old; for opal colours are obtained
only by a skilful process and the addition of putty,
bone-ashes, and other substances. Still earlier was the invention
of making hollow glass beads, which were incrusted
on the inside with a pearl-coloured varnish. This method
was first pursued, as far as I have been able to learn, by some
artists at Murano; but their invention seems to have been
considered by the government as too fraudulent, and was
therefore prohibited, as we are told by Francis Massarius,
who lived in the beginning of the sixteenth century at Venice,
and must therefore have had an opportunity of knowing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
truth of this <span class="locked">circumstance<a name="FNanchor_779" id="FNanchor_779" href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor">779</a></span>. Some say that an amalgam of
quicksilver was used for these pearls; and if that was the
case, the object of the Venetian prohibition was rather of a
medical nature. After this, small balls of wax or gum were
covered with a pearl-coloured enamel. These were praised
on account of their lustre; but as their beauty was destroyed
by moisture, they did not continue long in <span class="locked">use<a name="FNanchor_780" id="FNanchor_780" href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor">780</a></span>. A French
bead-maker, however, named Jaquin, at length found out the
manner of preparing the glass pearls used at present, which
excel all others, and which approach as near to nature as possible,
without being too expensive.</p>

<p>Jaquin once observed, at his estate near Passy, that when
those small fish called <i>ables</i> or <i>ablettes</i> were washed, the water
was filled with fine silver-coloured particles. He suffered this
water therefore to stand for some time, and obtained from it
a sediment which had the lustre of the most beautiful pearls;
and which on that account led him to the attempt of making
pearls from <span class="locked">it<a name="FNanchor_781" id="FNanchor_781" href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor">781</a></span>. He scraped off the scales of the fish, and
called the soft shining powder, which was diffused in the
water, essence of pearl, or <i>essence d’orient</i><a name="FNanchor_782" id="FNanchor_782" href="#Footnote_782" class="fnanchor">782</a>. At first he covered
with it small beads made of gypsum, or hardened paste;
and, as everything new, particularly in France, is eagerly
sought after, this invention was greatly admired and commended.
The ladies, however, for whose use it was chiefly
intended, soon found that it did not entirely answer their expectations.
They were displeased because this pearly coat,
when exposed to heat, separated from the beads, adhered to
the skin, and gave it a brightness which they did not wish.
They proposed themselves, that small hollow glass beads
might be covered, in the inside, in the same manner as mirrors
are silvered, with the essence of pearl; and thus was
brought to perfection an art of which the following account
will enable the reader to form some idea.</p>

<p>Of a kind of glass easy to be melted, and made sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
a little bluish or dark, slender tubes are prepared, which are
called <i>girasols</i><a name="FNanchor_783" id="FNanchor_783" href="#Footnote_783" class="fnanchor">783</a>. From these the artist blows, by means of a
lamp, as many small hollow globules as he may have occasion
for. One workman can in a day blow six thousand; but when
they are required to be extremely beautiful, only twelve or
fifteen hundred; and that they may have a greater resemblance
to nature, he gives them sometimes blemishes, like
those generally observed in real pearls. They are made on
all figures; some shaped like a pear, others like an olive, and
some that may be considered as <i>coques de perles</i><a name="FNanchor_784" id="FNanchor_784" href="#Footnote_784" class="fnanchor">784</a>. To overlie
these thin glass bubbles he mixes the pearl essence with
a solution of isinglass; and the more of the former he uses,
the more beautiful and more valuable the pearls become.
This varnish, when heated, he blows into each globule with a
fine glass pipe, and spreads it over the whole internal surface,
by shaking the pearls thus prepared in a vessel placed
over the table where he is at work, and which he puts in motion
by his foot, until the varnish is equally diffused all over
the inside of them, and becomes dry. Sometimes he adds to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
the essence some red, yellow, or blue colour; but as this is a
deviation from nature, it is not accounted a beauty. To give
these tender globules more solidity and strength, they are
filled with white wax. They are then bored through with a
needle, and threaded in strings for sale. The holes in the
finer sort, however, are first lined with thin paper, that the
thread may not adhere to the <span class="locked">wax<a name="FNanchor_785" id="FNanchor_785" href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor">785</a></span>.</p>

<p>The name <i>able</i>, or <i>ablette</i>, is given to several species of
fish; but that which produces the pearl-essence is the <i>Cyprinus
alburnus</i>, called in English the bleak. Professor Hermann,
at Strasburg, was so kind as to send me one of these
fish, which was caught there for the purpose of making pearl-essence,
and which was dried so carefully that the species could
with certainty be distinguished. It corresponded exactly with
the figure given in <span class="locked">Duhamel<a name="FNanchor_786" id="FNanchor_786" href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor">786</a></span>, which has almost a perfect resemblance
to that given by <span class="locked">Schoneveld<a name="FNanchor_787" id="FNanchor_787" href="#Footnote_787" class="fnanchor">787</a></span>. May not the <i>alburnus</i>
mentioned by Ausonius among the inhabitants of the
Moselle, be the same? At any rate, the bleak is to be found
only in fresh water; and on account of its voracity bites readily
at the hook. It is caught for the use of the French manufacturers
in the Seine, the Loire, the Saone, the <span class="locked">Rhine<a name="FNanchor_788" id="FNanchor_788" href="#Footnote_788" class="fnanchor">788</a></span>, and
several other rivers. To obtain a pound of scales above 4000
fish are necessary; and these do not produce four ounces of
pearl essence; so that from eighteen to twenty thousand are
requisite to have a pound of it. In the Chalonnois, the fishermen
get for a pound of washed scales fifteen, eighteen, and
twenty-five livres. The fish, which are four inches in length,
and which have not a very good taste, are sold at a cheap
rate, after their scales have been scraped off. At St. John de
Maizel, or Mezel, in the Chalonnois, there was a manufactory
in which 10,000 pearls were made <span class="locked">daily<a name="FNanchor_789" id="FNanchor_789" href="#Footnote_789" class="fnanchor">789</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
The first makers of these pearls must have laboured under
a very great inconvenience, as they were acquainted with no
method of preserving the fishy particles for any time. They
were obliged to use the essence immediately, because it soon
putrefied and contracted an intolerable stench. The great consumption,
however, required that the scales should be brought
from distant provinces. Attempts were made to preserve them
in spirit of wine or brandy; but these liquors destroyed their
lustre, and left them only a dull white colour. In the like
manner brandy spoiled a real pearl, which, with the animal
and the shell (<i>Mactra lutraria</i>), was sent to me by Dr. Taube,
at Zell. It was therefore a very important discovery for this
art that these animal particles can be kept for a long time in
solution of ammonia, which is now alone used, and which
perhaps could be used for many other purposes of the like
kind.</p>

<p>That the inventor of these pearls was called Jaquin, and that
he was a bead-maker at Paris, all agree; but the time of the
invention seems to be uncertain. Some say that it belongs to
the reign of Henry <span class="locked">IV.<a name="FNanchor_790" id="FNanchor_790" href="#Footnote_790" class="fnanchor">790</a></span>; and Reaumur mentions the year
1656. These pearls, however, in the year 1686, when Jaquin
had an assistant named Breton, must not have been very common;
for we are told in the Mercure Galant of that year, that
a marquis possessed of very little property, who was enamoured
of a lady, gained her affections and carried his point by presenting
her with a string of them, which cost only three louis;
and which she, considering them as real ones, valued at 2000
francs. The servant who put the marquis on this stratagem,
declared that these pearls withstood heat and the moisture occasioned
by perspiration; that they were not easily scratched,
had almost the same weight as real ones, and that the person
who sold them warranted their durability in writing. Jewellers
and pawnbrokers have, therefore, been often deceived by
them. Jaquin’s heirs continued this business down to a late
period, and had a considerable manufactory au Rue de Petit
Lion at Paris.</p>

<p class="fn3"><a name="Footnote_757" id="Footnote_757" href="#FNanchor_757" class="fnanchor">757</a>  It was because pearls are calcareous that Cleopatra was able to dissolve
hers in vinegar, and by these means to gain a bet from her lover, as we are
told by Pliny, 1. ix. c. 35, and Macrobius Saturn. 1. ii. c. 13. She must,
however, have employed stronger vinegar than that which we use for our
tables, as pearls, on account of their hardness and their natural enamel,
cannot be easily dissolved by a weak acid. Nature has secured the teeth
of animals against the effects of acids, by an enamel covering which answers
the same purpose; but if this enamel happen to be injured only in one small
place, the teeth soon spoil and rot. Cleopatra perhaps broke and pounded
the pearls; and it is probable that she afterwards diluted the vinegar with
water, that she might be able to drink it; though dissolved calcareous
matter neutralizes acids and renders them imperceptible to the tongue.
We are told that the dissipated Clodius gave to each of his guests a pearl
dissolved in vinegar to drink:&mdash;“Ut experiretur in gloria palati,” says Pliny,
“quid saperent margaritæ; atque ut mire placuere, ne solus hoc sciret, singulos
uniones convivis absorbendos dedit.” Horace, lib. ii. sat. 3, says the
same. That pearls are soluble in vinegar is remarked in Pausanias, b. viii.
ch. 18, and Vitruvius, b. viii. ch. 3.</p></div>

This principle has been applied by Mr. Barton and others to the making of

of the colours is this: the surfaces of the grooves, from their varied
inclinations, reflect the incident white light at various angles, hence the
correspondence of the luminous undulations is interrupted and some of
them check or interfere with one another, others continue their course.
Now, ordinary white light being a mixture of coloured rays, when some of

<i>perles coques</i>; but the following account of Pouget in Traité des Pierres

coque de perle</i>,” says he, “is not formed in a pearl-shell like the pearl; it
is procured from a kind of snail found only in the East Indies. There are
several species of them. The shell of this animal is sawn in two, and one
<i>coque</i> only can be obtained from each. The <i>coques</i> are very small, and one
is obliged to fill them with tears of mastic to give them a body, before they
can be employed. This beautiful snail is found generally in the sea, and
sometimes on the shore.” May not Pouget here mean that kind of snail
which others call <i>burgeau</i>, the shells of which are, in commerce, known by
the French under the name of <i>burgaudines</i>? Should that be the case, the
animal meant would be the <i>Nautilus Pompilius</i>, as may be concluded from
Histoire des Antilles, par Du Tertre, ii. p. 239. For the author says, “C’est
de leur coque que les ouvriers en nacre tirent cette belle nacre qu’ils appellent
la burgaudine, plus estimée que la nacre de perle.” Irregular
pearls are called <i>baroques</i>, or Scotch pearls, because abundance of such were
once found at Perth in Scotland. Some years ago artificial pearls of an
unnatural size, called Scotch pearls, were for a little time in fashion.</p></div>

<h2 id="paving">PAVING OF STREETS.</h2>

<p>The most beneficial regulations of police, which we have inherited
from our ancestors, are at present considered to be
so indispensable or necessary, that many people imagine they
must at all times have existed. If one, however, takes the
trouble to inquire into the antiquity of these regulations, it
will be found that the greater part of them are new, and that
they were unknown to the largest and most magnificent cities
of ancient times. Among these are <span class="locked">posts<a name="FNanchor_791" id="FNanchor_791" href="#Footnote_791" class="fnanchor">791</a></span>, the night-watch,
hackney coaches, and, besides many others, the paving of
streets.</p>

<p>Several cities, indeed, had paved streets before the beginning
of the Christian æra; but those which are at present the
ornament of Europe, Rome excepted, were all destitute of this
great advantage, till almost the twelfth or thirteenth century.
I must nevertheless acknowledge, that in the Greek and Roman
authors I have hitherto met with more proofs of paved
highways than of paved streets. But we have reason to believe
that the richest nations paid attention to the streets before
their doors, sooner than to the roads before their gates.
In all probability, the former were paved at different times,
and by private persons; and required so little expense and so
few regulations, that no occasion was given to remark the time
when it was done. On the other hand, for the constructing
of highways many miles in length, the concurrence of states,
and the consent and assistance of all the inhabitants, were necessary;
and, on that account, such circumstances were inserted
in annals, and they were sometimes copied afterwards
by historians, and mentioned in their works. In the East,
where the roads are not spoiled, as among us, by snow, ice,
and rain, and where many cities were built on eminences and
in dry situations, the paving of streets and highways may have
been later thought of than might be expected, when we consider<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
the refinement of the ancient people who inhabited that
country, and the progress they had made in the arts. Such
undertakings also were often retarded by the want of stone;
an obstacle which many nations overcame with an ingenuity
and patience at which we, among whom workmen are fewer,
and the price of labour higher, because we have more wants,
and enjoy more liberty, are not a little astonished. It is however
to be conjectured, that those people who first carried on
the greatest trade were the first who paid attention to have
good streets and highways, in order to facilitate intercourse,
so necessary to keep up the spirit of commerce.</p>

<p>This conjecture is in some measure confirmed by the testimony
of <span class="locked">Isidorus<a name="FNanchor_792" id="FNanchor_792" href="#Footnote_792" class="fnanchor">792</a></span>, who says that the Carthaginians had the
first paved streets, and that their example was soon copied by
the Romans. Long before that period, however, Semiramis
paved highways, as we are told by the vain-glorious inscription
which she herself caused to be put <span class="locked">up<a name="FNanchor_793" id="FNanchor_793" href="#Footnote_793" class="fnanchor">793</a></span>. Of the paving
of the Grecian cities I know nothing further than that at
Thebes the streets were under the inspection of the telearchs,
who had the care of keeping them in repair, and of cleaning
them. This office, which was there held in contempt, the
spiteful inhabitants conferred upon Epaminondas, in order to
disgrace him; but, by his prudence and attention to the public
good, he rendered it so respectable, that it was afterwards
sought for as an honourable employment. The streets of
Thebes, therefore, were paved, else how would it have been
possible to clean <span class="locked">them<a name="FNanchor_794" id="FNanchor_794" href="#Footnote_794" class="fnanchor">794</a></span>? Whether Jerusalem was paved I
do not know; for, in the first book of Kings mention is made
only of the fore-court of the <span class="locked">temple<a name="FNanchor_795" id="FNanchor_795" href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor">795</a></span>. <span class="locked">Josephus<a name="FNanchor_796" id="FNanchor_796" href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor">796</a></span> relates that
the Jews proposed to Agrippa, after the building of the temple
was finished, to employ the workmen who had been discharged,
the number of whom, with Jewish exaggeration, he
makes amount to eighteen thousand, in paving the streets;
this however was not done. We read in the <span class="locked">Talmud<a name="FNanchor_797" id="FNanchor_797" href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor">797</a></span>, that
the streets of Jerusalem were swept every day, which undoubtedly
implies a hard and solid pavement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
That neither the streets of Rome nor the roads around it
were paved during the time of its kings, is well <span class="locked">known<a name="FNanchor_798" id="FNanchor_798" href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor">798</a></span>. In the
year 188, after the abolition of the monarchical form of government,
Appius Claudius, who was then censor, constructed the
first real highway, which was as properly called after him the
Appian Way, as it was named on account of its excellence the
queen of <span class="locked">roads<a name="FNanchor_799" id="FNanchor_799" href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor">799</a></span>. The time however when the streets began
to be paved, cannot with certainty be determined; for the
passage of <span class="locked">Livy<a name="FNanchor_800" id="FNanchor_800" href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor">800</a></span>, from which some have endeavoured to prove
that it was in the year 578 after the building of the city, is
inconclusive, as it will admit of various explanations equally
probable. It may be read, without forcing the sense, as if Livy
said that the pavement of the streets was then covered with sand
for the first time; that the streets were then first paved at the
public expense, or that the paving of them was then performed
for the first time by contract. Besides, we are told by Livy
<span class="locked">himself<a name="FNanchor_801" id="FNanchor_801" href="#Footnote_801" class="fnanchor">801</a></span>, that the censors in the year of the city 584 caused
the streets to be paved from the Oxen-market (Forum Boarium)
to the temple of Venus, and around the seats of the magistrates
in the great circus: but the information of the same
historian that the ædiles in the year 459 caused the streets to
be paved from the temple of Mars to the Bovile, and from the
Capena gate to the temple of <span class="locked">Mars<a name="FNanchor_802" id="FNanchor_802" href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor">802</a></span>, does not apply here, as
some have imagined; for the temple of Mars was without the
city, and the author speaks not of streets, but of highways.
The extravagant Heliogabalus caused the streets around the
palace, or on the Palatine mount, to be paved with foreign
<span class="locked">marble<a name="FNanchor_803" id="FNanchor_803" href="#Footnote_803" class="fnanchor">803</a></span>. The inspection of the streets belonged to the ædiles;
and, under certain circumstances, occasionally to the censors.
In the course of time, however, particular officers, curatores
viarum, called on account of their number quatuor viri viarum,
were appointed for that express purpose. Thus we are told
that the two brothers, Publii Malleoli, when curule ædiles,
caused the Mons Publicius to be paved, so that carriages could
pass from the street Velia to Mount <span class="locked">Aventine<a name="FNanchor_804" id="FNanchor_804" href="#Footnote_804" class="fnanchor">804</a></span>. That streets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
paved with lava, having deep ruts made by the wheels of carriages,
and raised banks on each side for the accommodation
of foot-passengers, were found both at Herculaneum and Pompeii,
is well known from the information of various travellers.</p>

<p>Of modern cities, the oldest pavement is commonly ascribed
to that of Paris; but it is certain that Cordova in Spain was
paved so early as the middle of the ninth century, or about
the year 850, by Abdorrahman II., the fourth Spanish caliph.
This prince, who knew the value of the arts and sciences, and
who favoured trade so much that abundance in his reign prevailed
throughout the whole <span class="locked">land<a name="FNanchor_805" id="FNanchor_805" href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor">805</a></span>, caused water to be conveyed
into that city, which was then his capital, by leaden
pipes, and ornamented it with a mosque and other elegant
<span class="locked">buildings<a name="FNanchor_806" id="FNanchor_806" href="#Footnote_806" class="fnanchor">806</a></span>.</p>

<p>The capital of France was not paved in the twelfth century;
for Rigord, the physician and historian of Philip II.,
relates, that the king standing one day at a window of his
palace near the Seine, and observing that the carriages which
passed threw up the dirt in such a manner that it produced a
most offensive stench, his majesty resolved to remedy this intolerable
nuisance by causing the streets to be paved; which
was accordingly done, notwithstanding the heavy expense that
had prevented his predecessors from introducing the same
improvement. The orders for this purpose were issued by
the government in the year 1184; and upon that occasion, as
is said, the name of the city, which was then called Lutetia on
account of its dirtiness, was changed to that of <span class="locked">Paris<a name="FNanchor_807" id="FNanchor_807" href="#Footnote_807" class="fnanchor">807</a></span>. This
service rendered to Paris by that sovereign, who first also
caused the cathedral to be surrounded by a wall, is confirmed
by various <span class="locked">historians<a name="FNanchor_808" id="FNanchor_808" href="#Footnote_808" class="fnanchor">808</a></span>. Mezeray informs us, that Gerard
de Poissy, then intendant of the finances, expended eleven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
thousand marks of silver in this undertaking. It appears that
a certain income was allowed to the city for defraying the expenses;
for in 1285, a hundred years after, when it was proposed
that the pavement should be carried without the gate of
St. Martin, the citizens excused themselves from the work, by
saying that the funds assigned to them were not sufficient for
that <span class="locked">purpose<a name="FNanchor_809" id="FNanchor_809" href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor">809</a></span>. It is certain, that in the year 1641 the streets
in many quarters of Paris were not <span class="locked">paved<a name="FNanchor_810" id="FNanchor_810" href="#Footnote_810" class="fnanchor">810</a></span>.</p>

<p>It is very probable that other opulent cities, finding the
benefit which the capital derived from this improvement, were
induced to follow its example. At any rate we know that
Dijon, which was then reckoned one of the most beautiful, had
paved streets so early as the year 1391, to which Philip the
Bold, duke of Burgundy, the second husband of Margaret
heiress of Flanders and other parts of the Netherlands, contributed
two thousand livres; and in 1424 paviors were employed
on all the <span class="locked">streets<a name="FNanchor_811" id="FNanchor_811" href="#Footnote_811" class="fnanchor">811</a></span>. Historians remark, that after this period,
dangerous diseases, such as the dysentery, spotted fever and
others, became less frequent in that city.</p>

<p>That the streets of London were not paved at the end of
the eleventh century, is asserted by all historians. As a proof
of this, they relate that in the year 1090, when the church of
St. Mary-le-Bow, in Cheapside, was unroofed by a violent
storm of wind, four pillars or beams, which were twenty-six
feet in length, sunk so deep into the ground, that scarcely
four feet of them appeared above the surface. The streets of
London then, says Howel, were not paved, but consisted of
soft <span class="locked">earth<a name="FNanchor_812" id="FNanchor_812" href="#Footnote_812" class="fnanchor">812</a></span>. I can however find no account of the time when
paving was first introduced. It appears that the pavement of
this immense city became gradually extended as trade and
opulence increased. Several of the principal streets, such as
Holborn, which at present are in the middle of the city, were
paved for the first time by royal command in the year <span class="locked">1417<a name="FNanchor_813" id="FNanchor_813" href="#Footnote_813" class="fnanchor">813</a></span>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
Others were paved under Henry VIII., some in the <span class="locked">suburbs<a name="FNanchor_814" id="FNanchor_814" href="#Footnote_814" class="fnanchor">814</a></span>
in 1544, others in 1571 and 1605, and the great market of
Smithfield, where cattle are sold, was first paved in <span class="locked">1614<a name="FNanchor_815" id="FNanchor_815" href="#Footnote_815" class="fnanchor">815</a></span>.</p>

<p>Of German cities I can mention only Augsburg, which by
its trade soon rose to such eminence as to be able to rival
magnificent Rome, of which it was a colony, in many expensive
improvements. This city from the earliest periods had
small subterranean passages under the streets for conveying
away filth, which in some measure resembled the Roman
<i>cloacæ</i>. Hans Gwerlich, a rich merchant there, having caused
a neat foot-path to be made before his house in the oxen-market
in 1415, gave rise to the paving of the city; for this
convenience was so much admired, that after that time all the
streets were paved successively at the expense of the government.
Berlin, in the first half of the seventeenth century, was
not entirely paved. The new market was first paved in 1679
and the following years, and King-street before the houses in
1684. The square behind the cathedral and before the present
tilt-yard remained without pavement in 1679.</p>

<p>When a solid bottom had been given to streets, the cleansing
of them, which, as the Roman prætors said, is a continual
<span class="locked">improvement<a name="FNanchor_816" id="FNanchor_816" href="#Footnote_816" class="fnanchor">816</a></span>, was then rendered possible. At Rome were
appointed <i>tribuni rerum nitentium</i>, who had the care of cleaning
the streets, markets, temples, baths and other public <span class="locked">places<a name="FNanchor_817" id="FNanchor_817" href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor">817</a></span>.
Strict orders were given that no filth should be thrown into
the river or streets; whoever transgressed against this prohibition
was subjected to punishment, and obliged to repair the
<span class="locked">damage<a name="FNanchor_818" id="FNanchor_818" href="#Footnote_818" class="fnanchor">818</a></span>. The public sewers, <i>cloacæ</i>, under the streets contributed
very much to facilitate the cleaning of them, yet they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
were commonly full of <span class="locked">mud<a name="FNanchor_819" id="FNanchor_819" href="#Footnote_819" class="fnanchor">819</a></span>, as those of Paris are at present,
notwithstanding the many expensive regulations established to
prevent that nuisance.</p>

<p>Some centuries after Paris was paved, every citizen was
obliged to repair the street before his house, and to clean it at
his own expense, as is expressly commanded in an order issued
by Philip the <span class="locked">Bold<a name="FNanchor_820" id="FNanchor_820" href="#Footnote_820" class="fnanchor">820</a></span>, in the year 1285. The public however
are often careless and negligent respecting the most beneficial
regulations, when the maintaining of them is attended with
trouble and expense, be it ever so small. By this want of attention,
all the streets of Paris were in the fourteenth century
entirely spoiled and filled with dirt; but they were again repaired;
and in 1348 a law was first made for inflicting punishment
upon those who neglected to clean <span class="locked">them<a name="FNanchor_821" id="FNanchor_821" href="#Footnote_821" class="fnanchor">821</a></span>. This law was
rendered more severe in 1388, and several times afterwards.
The novelty of it, the dread of punishment, and the vigilance
of the new inspectors, produced such an effect, that the inhabitants
of one or more neighbouring streets joined together
and kept at their common expense a dirt-cart, which at
that time was called <i>un tombereau</i>; but the nobility and the
clergy, who always wish for immunities, endeavoured to exempt
themselves from this burthen. The markets and public
squares remained therefore uncleaned, and became still dirtier,
as those who resided in the neighbourhood began to
throw filth into them privately in the night-time, in order to
avoid the expense of having it carried away, till at length
these places were rendered so impassable that the toymen who
frequented them with their wares wished to abandon them.
For this reason it was enacted in the year 1399, that no one
should be exempted from cleaning the streets; and an order
was issued in 1374, that all those who lived in the markets,
together with the toymen who had booths there, should clean
them at their joint <span class="locked">expenses<a name="FNanchor_822" id="FNanchor_822" href="#Footnote_822" class="fnanchor">822</a></span>. Many now made the removing
of dirt a trade, and entered into contracts for that purpose;
but they as well as the paviors turned so extravagant in their
demands, that a price was set upon the labour of the former
in 1396, and the latter in 1501 were united into a company,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
every member of which was obliged to subscribe to certain
<span class="locked">regulations<a name="FNanchor_823" id="FNanchor_823" href="#Footnote_823" class="fnanchor">823</a></span>.</p>

<p>When the city at length increased in size and population,
the cleaning of the streets became too troublesome and expensive
to be left any longer to the care of individuals. Besides,
those who inhabited the suburbs complained, and with
great justice, that the burthen lay so heavy upon them as to
be intolerable; because all the carts which entered the city, or
which conveyed filth from it, rendered their streets much dirtier
than the rest. It was resolved therefore, in the year 1609,
that the streets should be cleaned at the public expense, under
the inspection of the police; and a certain revenue in wine
was set apart for that purpose. The first person with whom
a contract was entered into for this service, was allowed
yearly, for cleaning the whole city, 70,000 livres, which sum
was raised in 1628 to <span class="locked">80,000<a name="FNanchor_824" id="FNanchor_824" href="#Footnote_824" class="fnanchor">824</a></span>. In 1704, the Parisians were
obliged to collect 300,000 livres, for which Government undertook
to maintain the lamps and clean the streets; but in
1722 this contribution was increased to 450,000. The last
contract with which I am acquainted is that of the year 1748,
by which the contractors were to be allowed yearly, during
six years, for removing the dirt, 200,000 livres, and for clearing
away the snow and ice in winter 6000 more, making in all the
sum of 206,000 <span class="locked">livres<a name="FNanchor_825" id="FNanchor_825" href="#Footnote_825" class="fnanchor">825</a></span>.</p>

<p>All these regulations and expenses however would undoubtedly
have been attended with very little benefit, had not deliberate
dirtying of the streets been strictly prohibited, and all
opportunities of doing so been as much as possible prevented.
As the young king Philip, whom his father Louis the Fat had
united with himself as co-regent, and caused to be crowned
at Rheims, was passing St. Gervais on horseback, a sow running
against his horse’s legs made him stumble, and the prince
being thrown was so much hurt, that he died next morning,
3rd October 1131. On account of this accident an order was
issued that no swine in future should be suffered to run about
in the streets; but this was opposed by the abbey of St. Anthony,
because, as the monks represented, it was contrary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
the respect due to their patron to prevent his swine from enjoying
the liberty of going where they thought proper. It
was found necessary therefore to grant these clergy an exclusive
privilege, and to allow their swine, if they had bells fastened
to their necks, to wallow in the dirt of the streets without
<span class="locked">molestation<a name="FNanchor_826" id="FNanchor_826" href="#Footnote_826" class="fnanchor">826</a></span>.</p>

<p>A very improper liberty prevailed at Paris in the fourteenth
century, which was, that all persons might throw anything
from their windows whenever they chose, provided they gave
notice three times before, by crying out <i>Gare l’eau</i>, which is
as much as to say, Take care of water. This privilege was
forbidden in 1372, and still more severely in <span class="locked">1395<a name="FNanchor_827" id="FNanchor_827" href="#Footnote_827" class="fnanchor">827</a></span>. A
like practice however seems to have continued longer at
Edinburgh; for in the year 1750, when people went out into
the streets at night, it was necessary, in order to avoid disagreeable
accidents from the windows, that they should take
with them a guide, who as he went along called out with a
loud voice, in the Scotch dialect, <i>Haud your haunde</i>, Stop your
<span class="locked">hand<a name="FNanchor_828" id="FNanchor_828" href="#Footnote_828" class="fnanchor">828</a></span>.</p>

<p>This practice however would not have been suppressed at
Paris, had not the police paid particular attention to promote
the interior cleanliness of the houses, and the erection of
privies. Some will perhaps be astonished that these conveniences
should have been first introduced into the capital of
France by an order from government in the sixteenth century;
especially as they are at present considered to be so indispensably
necessary, that few summer-houses are constructed without
them. Those however to whom this affords matter of
surprise must be still more astonished when they are told that
the residence of the king of Spain was destitute of this improvement
at the very time that the English circumnavigators<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
found privies constructed in the European manner near the
habitations of the cannibals of New <span class="locked">Zealand<a name="FNanchor_829" id="FNanchor_829" href="#Footnote_829" class="fnanchor">829</a></span>. But Madrid
is not the royal residence which has had dirty streets longest
on account of this want. Privies began to be erected at Warsaw
for the first time only within these few <span class="locked">years<a name="FNanchor_830" id="FNanchor_830" href="#Footnote_830" class="fnanchor">830</a></span>.</p>

<p>In the Parisian code of laws, <i>Coûtume de Paris</i>, which was
improved and confirmed in 1513, it is expressly ordered, that
every house should have a <span class="locked">privy<a name="FNanchor_831" id="FNanchor_831" href="#Footnote_831" class="fnanchor">831</a></span>. This order, with the denunciation
of severer punishment in case of disobedience,
was renewed in 1533; and in 1538 the under officers of police
were obliged to examine the houses and to report the names
of those who had not complied with this beneficial regulation.
It appears, however, that the order of 1533 was not the latest;
for in 1697, and even in 1700, the police was under the
necessity of strictly commanding “that people should construct
privies in their houses, and repair those already constructed,
and that within a month at furthest, under the penalty of
being fined in case of neglect, and of having their houses shut
up until they should be in a proper condition.” This order is
given in the same words in the Coûtume de Mante, Etampes,
Nivernois, Bourbonnois, Calais, Tournay, and <span class="locked">Melun<a name="FNanchor_832" id="FNanchor_832" href="#Footnote_832" class="fnanchor">832</a></span>. That
issued at Bordeaux is of the year 1585.</p>

<p>All these regulations of police were not much older in Germany
than in Paris. The cleaning of the streets was considered
there as an almost dishonourable employment, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
in some places was assigned to the Jews, and in others to the
executioner’s servants. The Jews were obliged to clean the
streets of Hamburgh before the present regulations were
established. How old these may be I do not know, but in
the year 1585 there were dirt carts in that city, and a tax was
paid by the inhabitants for supporting them. At Spandau, in
1573, the skinners were obliged to sweep the market-place,
which was not then paved, and for this service they were paid
by the <span class="locked">council<a name="FNanchor_833" id="FNanchor_833" href="#Footnote_833" class="fnanchor">833</a></span>. In the beginning of the seventeenth century
the streets of Berlin were never swept, and the swine belonging
to the citizens wallowed in the increasing dirt the whole day,
as well as in the kennels, which were choked up with mud.
In the year 1624, when the elector desired the council to order
the streets to be cleaned, they replied, that it would then be of
no use, as the citizens at that time were busy with their farms.
Near Peter’s church there was a heap of dust so large that it
almost prevented people from passing, and it was with great
difficulty, and not until strict orders had been often repeated,
that the elector could get the inhabitants to remove it. For
a long time dirt of every kind was emptied in the new market-place,
and lay there in such quantity, that an order was issued
in 1671, that every countryman who came to the market should
carry back with him a load of dirt. The director of the public
mill made continual complaints, that, by the dirt being shot
down near the long bridge, the mill-dam was prevented from
flowing. Hog-sties were erected in the streets, sometimes even
under the windows. This practice was forbidden by the
council in <span class="locked">1641<a name="FNanchor_834" id="FNanchor_834" href="#Footnote_834" class="fnanchor">834</a></span>; but it was nevertheless continued, until the
elector at length, in the year 1681, gave orders that the
inhabitants should not feed swine; and this prohibition was
carried into effect without any exception, as St. Anthony had
no abbeys at Berlin. Privies, however, seem to have been
common in the large and flourishing towns of Germany much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
earlier than in the capital of France; and those who are not
disposed to find fault with me for introducing proofs here which
historians have not disdained to record, may read what
<span class="locked">follows<a name="FNanchor_835" id="FNanchor_835" href="#Footnote_835" class="fnanchor">835</a></span>:&mdash;In the annals of Frankfort on the Maine, where
mention is made of the cheapness of former times, we are told
how much a citizen there gave in the year 1477 for cleaning
his <span class="locked">privy<a name="FNanchor_836" id="FNanchor_836" href="#Footnote_836" class="fnanchor">836</a></span>. We are informed also, that in 1496 an order was
issued by the council forbidding the proprietors of houses
situated in a certain place planted with trees to erect privies
towards the side where the trees were growing; and that in
1498, George Pfeffer von Hell, J.U.D. and chancellor of the
electorate of Mentz, fell by accident into a privy, and there
perished. It appears however from the streets and houses of
most of our cities, that they were constructed before such
conveniences were thought of, and that these were erected
through force at a later <span class="locked">period<a name="FNanchor_837" id="FNanchor_837" href="#Footnote_837" class="fnanchor">837</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
[A new era in paving has been commenced by the substitution
of wood for stone, but unfortunately, its vast superiority
in some respects is nearly if not quite counterbalanced by its
defects, so that it will probably be laid aside. An imperfect
kind of wooden <i>pavement</i> has been much used in North America,
and is known by the name of <i>corduroy road</i>; but the
wooden pavement, properly so called, seems to have been first
used in Russia, and within the last few years, on a small scale
at Vienna, New York, &amp;c. Its use in London was first
suggested by Mr. Finlayson in 1825. It was originally formed
of hexagonal prismatic pieces of wood, the grain of which was
placed vertically. The blocks have been kept together in various
ways, some by mere position, others by wooden pegs, strong
iron wire, &amp;c. The great disadvantage of wooden pavement
is that it becomes slippery in wet weather. Attempts have
been made to remedy this defect, by raising those in the centre
above the level of the lateral ones, or grooving the surfaces
of the blocks. Another objection to wooden pavement is the
difficulty of laying a firm and durable foundation. The retention
of water by the spaces left between the blocks and in the
pores of the wood itself, whereby an atmosphere of moisture is
continually preserved, has also been considered as likely to
predispose to certain diseases. Whether the latter is true or
not, the short duration of their adoption has hardly afforded
sufficient opportunities of deciding. The checking of the vibrations
communicated from vehicles constantly running in
the streets, renders the wooden pavement of extreme value; its
durability has also been stated on good authority to exceed
that of stone, and its expense to be less. In these particulars
however it has not answered expectation; and from the immense
number of horses which are daily thrown down, from the want of
resisting points on its surface, its use will probably be abandoned;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
and in several of the large thoroughfares where it had
been adopted it is now being replaced by stone.</p>

<p>A very valuable material for the formation of foot-pavements
has been found and patented in <i>asphalte</i>. That which
has been most used for this purpose is the native asphalte
from Seyssel; it is mixed with a small quantity of native bitumen
and sand. In preparing it, 93 parts of native asphalte
are reduced to powder and seven of bitumen; these are melted
together and fine gravel or sand stirred in the mixture. It is
then spread upon a concrete foundation in layers about an inch
in thickness. Its elasticity renders it exceedingly durable.
Various compositions have been substituted for this mixture,
but we believe none have been found to answer so well. The
application of bituminous substances to carriage-pavements
has been almost exclusively limited to court-yards, but there
is very good evidence of its applicability to public thoroughfares,
in a piece of pavement, about 150 feet in length by 10
feet in width, laid down in 1838 at Whitehall, as a sample of
Messrs. Claridge’s patent. It still remains in perfect condition.
The principal objection to the general adoption of asphaltic
pavement in the streets of London, appears to be the difficulty
of raising and relaying it, a process so constantly required to
reach the innumerable gas and water-pipes beneath.</p>

<p>Pavements have been laid down, especially in court-yards
and stables, one of the principal constituents of which is
caoutchouc.]</p>

Something however must be allowed for the low situation of the town,
which renders drainage next to impracticable. Laing, in his Notes of a
Traveller, speaking of Berlin as he found it in 1841, says, “It is a fine city,
very like the age she represents&mdash;very fine and very nasty.... The streets
are spacious and straight, with broad margins on each side for foot-passengers;
and a band of plain flagstones on these margins make them much
more walkable than the streets of most continental towns. But these margins
are divided from the spacious carriage-way in the middle by open
kennels, telling the nose unutterable things. These open kennels are boarded
over only at the gateways of the palaces, to let the carriages cross them, and
must be particularly convenient to the inhabitants, for they are not at all
particularly agreeable. Use reconciles people to nuisances which might be
easily removed. A sluggish but considerable river, the Spree, stagnates
through the town, and the money laid out in stucco work and outside decoration
of the houses, would go far towards covering over their drains, raising
the water by engines and sending it in a purifying stream through every
street and sewer. If bronze and marble could smell, Blücher and Bülow,
Schwerin and Ziethen, and duck-winged angels, and two-headed eagles
innumerable, would be found on their pedestals holding their noses instead
of grasping their swords. It is a curious illustration of the difference
between the civilization of the fine arts and that of the useful arts, in their
influences on social well-being, that Berlin as yet has not advanced so far
in the enjoyments and comforts of life, in the civilization of the useful arts,
as to have water conveyed in pipes into its city and into its houses. Three
hundred thousand people have taste enough to be in die-away ecstasies
at the singing of Madame Pasta, or the dancing of Taglioni, and have not
taste enough to appreciate or feel the want of a supply of water in their
kitchens, sculleries, drains, sewers, and water-closets. The civilization of
an English village is, after all, more real civilization than that of Paris or
Berlin.”]</p></div></div>

<h2 id="collections">COLLECTIONS OF NATURAL CURIOSITIES.</h2>

<p>If it be true that the written accounts which those who had
recovered from sickness caused to be drawn out of their cure,
their disorder, and the medicines employed to remove it, and
to be hung up in the temples, particularly that of Æsculapius,
were the first collections of medical <span class="locked">observations<a name="FNanchor_838" id="FNanchor_838" href="#Footnote_838" class="fnanchor">838</a></span>, as seems to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
appear by the testimony of Hippocrates, who did not disdain
to make use of them in order to acquire <span class="locked">information<a name="FNanchor_839" id="FNanchor_839" href="#Footnote_839" class="fnanchor">839</a></span>; we
have every reason to conjecture, that the rare animals, plants
and minerals, generally preserved in the temples also, were
the first collections of natural curiosities, and that they may
have contributed as much to promote the knowledge of natural
history, as those tablets to improve the art of medicine. Natural
objects of uncommon size or beauty, and other rare productions,
on which nature seemed to have exerted her utmost
power, were in the earliest periods consecrated to the <span class="locked">gods<a name="FNanchor_840" id="FNanchor_840" href="#Footnote_840" class="fnanchor">840</a></span>.
They were conveyed to the temples, where their value became
still enhanced by the sacredness and antiquity of the place;
where they continued more and more to excite respect and
awaken curiosity, and where they were preserved as memorials
to the latest generations, with the same reverence as the other
furniture of these buildings. In the course of time these
natural curiosities dedicated to the gods became so numerous,
that they formed collections which may be called large for
those periods, and for the infant state in which natural history
then was.</p>

<p>When Hanno returned from his distant voyages, he brought
with him to Carthage two skins of the hairy women whom he
found on the Gorgades islands, and deposited them as a memorial
in the temple of Juno, where they continued till the destruction
of the <span class="locked">city<a name="FNanchor_841" id="FNanchor_841" href="#Footnote_841" class="fnanchor">841</a></span>. The horns of a Scythian animal, in
which the Stygian water that destroyed every other vessel
could be contained, were sent by Alexander as a curiosity to
the temple of Delphi, where they were suspended, with an
inscription, which has been preserved by Ælian<a name="FNanchor_842" id="FNanchor_842" href="#Footnote_842" class="fnanchor">842</a>. The monstrous
horns of the wild bulls which had occasioned so much
devastation in Macedonia, were by order of king Philip hung
up in the temple of Hercules. The unnaturally formed shoulder-bones
of Pelops were deposited in the temple of <span class="locked">Elis<a name="FNanchor_843" id="FNanchor_843" href="#Footnote_843" class="fnanchor">843</a></span>. The
horns of the so-called Indian ants were shown in the temple
of Hercules at Erythræ<a name="FNanchor_844" id="FNanchor_844" href="#Footnote_844" class="fnanchor">844</a>; and the crocodile found in attempting
to discover the sources of the Nile was preserved in the
temple of Isis at Cæsarea<a name="FNanchor_845" id="FNanchor_845" href="#Footnote_845" class="fnanchor">845</a>. A large piece of the root of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
cinnamon-tree was kept in a golden vessel in one of the temples
at Rome, where it was examined by <span class="locked">Pliny<a name="FNanchor_846" id="FNanchor_846" href="#Footnote_846" class="fnanchor">846</a></span>. The skin of that
monster which the Roman army in Africa attacked and destroyed,
and which probably was a crocodile, an animal common
in that country, but never seen by the Romans before the
Punic war, was by Regulus sent to Rome, and hung up in one
of the temples, where it remained till the time of the Numantine
<span class="locked">war<a name="FNanchor_847" id="FNanchor_847" href="#Footnote_847" class="fnanchor">847</a></span>. In the temple of Juno, in the island of Melita, there
were a pair of elephant’s teeth of extraordinary size, which
were carried away by Masinissa’s admiral, and transmitted to
that prince, who, though he set a high value upon them, sent
them back again because he heard they had been taken from
a <span class="locked">temple<a name="FNanchor_848" id="FNanchor_848" href="#Footnote_848" class="fnanchor">848</a></span>. The head of a basilisc was exhibited in one of the
temples of <span class="locked">Diana<a name="FNanchor_849" id="FNanchor_849" href="#Footnote_849" class="fnanchor">849</a></span>; and the bones of that sea-monster, probably
a whale, to which Andromeda was exposed, were preserved
at Joppa, and afterwards brought to <span class="locked">Rome<a name="FNanchor_850" id="FNanchor_850" href="#Footnote_850" class="fnanchor">850</a></span>. In the time of
Pausanias, the head of the celebrated Calydonian boar was
shown in one of the temples of Greece; but it was then destitute
of bristles, and had suffered considerably by the hand
of time. The monstrous tusks of this animal were brought
to Rome, after the defeat of Antony, by the emperor Augustus,
who caused them to be suspended in the temple of
<span class="locked">Bacchus<a name="FNanchor_851" id="FNanchor_851" href="#Footnote_851" class="fnanchor">851</a></span>. Apollonius tells us, that he saw in India some of
those nuts which in Greece were preserved in the temples as
<span class="locked">curiosities<a name="FNanchor_852" id="FNanchor_852" href="#Footnote_852" class="fnanchor">852</a></span>.</p>

<p>It is certain, however, that all these articles, though preserved
in the temples of the ancients as rarities or memorials of remarkable
events, or as objects calculated to silence unbelief,
were not properly kept there for the purpose to which our
collections of natural curiosities are applied; but at the same
time it must be allowed that they might be of as much utility
to naturalists, as the tablets, in which patients who had recovered
thanked the gods for their cures, were to physicians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
We are told by Suetonius, that the emperor Augustus had
in his palace a collection of natural <span class="locked">curiosities<a name="FNanchor_853" id="FNanchor_853" href="#Footnote_853" class="fnanchor">853</a></span>. I, however,
do not remember that any of the ancient naturalists make
mention of their own private collections; though it is well
known that Alexander gave orders to all huntsmen, bird-catchers,
fishermen and others, to send to Aristotle whatever
animals they could <span class="locked">procure<a name="FNanchor_854" id="FNanchor_854" href="#Footnote_854" class="fnanchor">854</a></span>; and although Pliny was accustomed
to make observations on such as he had an opportunity
of seeing. No doubt can be entertained that a collection of
natural curiosities was formed by Apuleius, who, next to Aristotle
and his scholar Theophrastus, certainly examined natural
objects with the greatest ardour and judgement; who caused
animals of every kind, and particularly fish, to be brought to
him either dead or alive, in order to describe their external
and internal parts, their number and situation, and to determine
their characteristic peculiarities, and assign names to them;
who undertook distant journeys to become acquainted with
the secrets of nature; and who on the Getulian mountains
collected petrifactions, which he considered as the effects
of Deucalion’s flood. It is much to be lamented that the
zoological works of this learned and ingenious man have been
lost.</p>

<p>The principal cause why collections of natural curiosities
were scarce in ancient times, must have been the ignorance of
naturalists in regard to the proper means of preserving such
bodies as soon spoil or corrupt. Some methods were indeed
known and practised, but they were all defective and inferior
to that by spirit of wine, which prevents putrefaction, and which
by its perfect transparency permits objects covered by it to be
at all times viewed and examined. These methods were the
same as those employed to preserve provisions, or the bodies
of great men deceased. They were put into salt brine or
honey, or were covered over with wax.</p>

<p>It appears that in the earliest periods bodies were preserved
from corruption by means of <span class="locked">salt<a name="FNanchor_855" id="FNanchor_855" href="#Footnote_855" class="fnanchor">855</a></span>, and that this practice was
long continued. We are told that Pharnaces caused the body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
of his father Mithridates to be deposited in salt brine, in order
that he might transmit it to <span class="locked">Pompey<a name="FNanchor_856" id="FNanchor_856" href="#Footnote_856" class="fnanchor">856</a></span>. Eunapius, who lived
in the fifth century, relates that the monks preserved the heads
of the martyrs by means of <span class="locked">salt<a name="FNanchor_857" id="FNanchor_857" href="#Footnote_857" class="fnanchor">857</a></span>; and we are informed by
Sigebert, who died in 1113, that a like process was pursued
with the body of St. Guibert, that it might be kept during a
journey in <span class="locked">summer<a name="FNanchor_858" id="FNanchor_858" href="#Footnote_858" class="fnanchor">858</a></span>. In the same manner the priests preserved
the sow which afforded a happy omen to Æneas, by
having brought forth a litter of thirty pigs, as we are told by
Varro, in whose time the animal was still shown at <span class="locked">Lavinium<a name="FNanchor_859" id="FNanchor_859" href="#Footnote_859" class="fnanchor">859</a></span>.
A hippocentaur (probably a monstrous birth), caught in
Arabia, was brought alive to Egypt; and as it died there, it
was, after being preserved in salt brine, sent to Rome to the
emperor, and deposited in his collection, where it was shown
in the time of Pliny, and in that of <span class="locked">Phlegon<a name="FNanchor_860" id="FNanchor_860" href="#Footnote_860" class="fnanchor">860</a></span>. Another hippocentaur
was preserved by the like method, and transmitted
to the emperor Constantine at <span class="locked">Antioch<a name="FNanchor_861" id="FNanchor_861" href="#Footnote_861" class="fnanchor">861</a></span>; and a large ape of
the species called Pan, sent by the Indians to the emperor
Constantius, happening to die on the road by being shut up
in a cage, was placed in salt, and in that manner conveyed to
<span class="locked">Constantinople<a name="FNanchor_862" id="FNanchor_862" href="#Footnote_862" class="fnanchor">862</a></span>. This method of preserving natural objects
has been even employed in modern times to prevent large
bodies from being affected by corruption. The hippopotamus
described by Columna was sent to him from Egypt preserved
in <span class="locked">salt<a name="FNanchor_863" id="FNanchor_863" href="#Footnote_863" class="fnanchor">863</a></span>.</p>

<p>To put dead bodies in honey, for the purpose of securing
them from putrefaction, is an ancient <span class="locked">practice<a name="FNanchor_864" id="FNanchor_864" href="#Footnote_864" class="fnanchor">864</a></span>, and was used
at an early period by the <span class="locked">Assyrians<a name="FNanchor_865" id="FNanchor_865" href="#Footnote_865" class="fnanchor">865</a></span>. The body of Agesipolis
king of Sparta, who died in Macedonia, was sent home in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
<span class="locked">honey<a name="FNanchor_866" id="FNanchor_866" href="#Footnote_866" class="fnanchor">866</a></span>, as were also the bodies of <span class="locked">Agesilaus<a name="FNanchor_867" id="FNanchor_867" href="#Footnote_867" class="fnanchor">867</a></span> and <span class="locked">Aristobulus<a name="FNanchor_868" id="FNanchor_868" href="#Footnote_868" class="fnanchor">868</a></span>.
The faithless Cleomenes caused the head of Archonides to be
put in honey, and had it always placed near him when he was
deliberating upon any affair of great importance, in order to
fulfil the oath he had made to undertake nothing without consulting
his <span class="locked">head<a name="FNanchor_869" id="FNanchor_869" href="#Footnote_869" class="fnanchor">869</a></span>. According to the account of some authors,
the body of Alexander the Great was deposited in <span class="locked">honey<a name="FNanchor_870" id="FNanchor_870" href="#Footnote_870" class="fnanchor">870</a></span>,
though others relate that it was embalmed according to the
manner of the <span class="locked">Egyptians<a name="FNanchor_871" id="FNanchor_871" href="#Footnote_871" class="fnanchor">871</a></span>. The body of the emperor Justin
II. was also placed in honey mixed with <span class="locked">spices<a name="FNanchor_872" id="FNanchor_872" href="#Footnote_872" class="fnanchor">872</a></span>. The wish of
Democritus to be buried in <span class="locked">honey<a name="FNanchor_873" id="FNanchor_873" href="#Footnote_873" class="fnanchor">873</a></span> is likewise a confirmation
of this practice. Honey was often applied in ancient times to
purposes for which we use sugar. It was employed for preserving
<span class="locked">fruit<a name="FNanchor_874" id="FNanchor_874" href="#Footnote_874" class="fnanchor">874</a></span>; and this process is not disused at present. In
order to preserve fresh for many years the celebrated purple
dye of the ancients, honey was poured over <span class="locked">it<a name="FNanchor_875" id="FNanchor_875" href="#Footnote_875" class="fnanchor">875</a></span>, and certain
worms useful in medicine were kept free from corruption by
the like <span class="locked">means<a name="FNanchor_876" id="FNanchor_876" href="#Footnote_876" class="fnanchor">876</a></span>. By the same method also were natural
curiosities preserved, such as the hippocentaur already mentioned;
and it has been employed in later times, as is proved
by the account given by Alexander ab <span class="locked">Alexandro<a name="FNanchor_877" id="FNanchor_877" href="#Footnote_877" class="fnanchor">877</a></span>, respecting
the supposed mermen.</p>

<p>Among the <span class="locked">Scythians<a name="FNanchor_878" id="FNanchor_878" href="#Footnote_878" class="fnanchor">878</a></span>, <span class="locked">Assyrians<a name="FNanchor_879" id="FNanchor_879" href="#Footnote_879" class="fnanchor">879</a></span>, and <span class="locked">Persians<a name="FNanchor_880" id="FNanchor_880" href="#Footnote_880" class="fnanchor">880</a></span>, dead
bodies were covered over with wax. That of Agesilaus, because
honey could not be procured, was preserved in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
<span class="locked">manner<a name="FNanchor_881" id="FNanchor_881" href="#Footnote_881" class="fnanchor">881</a></span>, which indeed ought not to be despised even at present.
When the Orientals are desirous of transporting fish to
any distance, they cover them over with <span class="locked">wax<a name="FNanchor_882" id="FNanchor_882" href="#Footnote_882" class="fnanchor">882</a></span>; and the apples
carried every year to the northern parts of Siberia and Archangel,
from the southern districts of Russia, are first dipped in
melted wax, which, by forming a thick coat around them,
keeps out the air, and prevents them from spoiling. This
property has in my opinion given rise to the ancient custom
of wrapping up in wax-cloth the dead bodies of persons of
distinction. Linen, or perhaps silk, which had been done over
with wax, was used on such occasions, but not what we at
present distinguish by the name of wax-cloth, which is only
covered with an oil-varnish in imitation of the real kind. The
body of St. Ansbert, we are told, was wrapped up <i>linteo cerato</i>;
and a <i>camisale ceratum</i><a name="FNanchor_883" id="FNanchor_883" href="#Footnote_883" class="fnanchor">883</a> was drawn over the clothes which
covered that of St. Udalric. When Philip duke of Burgundy
died in 1404, his body was wrapped up in thirty-two ells <i>de
toile cirée</i><a name="FNanchor_884" id="FNanchor_884" href="#Footnote_884" class="fnanchor">884</a>. In an ancient record, respecting the ceremony
to be used in burying the kings of England, it is ordered that
the body shall be wrapped up in <span class="locked">wax-cloth<a name="FNanchor_885" id="FNanchor_885" href="#Footnote_885" class="fnanchor">885</a></span>. In the year
1774, when the grave of king Edward I., who died in 1307,
was opened, the body was found so closely wrapped up in
wax-cloth, that one could perfectly distinguish the form of the
hand, and the features of the <span class="locked">countenance<a name="FNanchor_886" id="FNanchor_886" href="#Footnote_886" class="fnanchor">886</a></span>. The body of
Johanna, mother of Edward the Black Prince, who died in
1359, was also wrapped up in <i>cerecloth</i>; and in like manner
the body of Elizabeth Tudor, the second daughter of Henry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
VII., was <i>cered by the wax-chandler</i><a name="FNanchor_887" id="FNanchor_887" href="#Footnote_887" class="fnanchor">887</a>. After the death of
George II., the apothecary was allowed one hundred and fifty-two
pounds for fine double wax-cloth, and other articles necessary
to embalm the <span class="locked">body<a name="FNanchor_888" id="FNanchor_888" href="#Footnote_888" class="fnanchor">888</a></span>. The books found in the grave
of Numa, as we learn from the Roman historians, though they
had been buried more than five hundred years, were, when
taken up, so entire, that they looked as if perfectly new, because
they had been closely surrounded with wax-candles. Wax-cloth
it is probable was not then known at <span class="locked">Rome<a name="FNanchor_889" id="FNanchor_889" href="#Footnote_889" class="fnanchor">889</a></span>.</p>

<p>In those centuries usually called the middle ages, I find no
traces of collections of this nature, except in the treasuries of
emperors, kings and princes, where, besides articles of great
value, curiosities of art, antiquities and relics, one sometimes
found scarce and singular foreign animals, which were dried
and preserved. Such objects were to be seen in the old treasury
at Vienna; and in that of St. Denis was exhibited the
claw of a griffin, sent by the king of Persia to Charlemagne;
the teeth of the hippopotamus, and other things of the like
<span class="locked">kind<a name="FNanchor_890" id="FNanchor_890" href="#Footnote_890" class="fnanchor">890</a></span>. In these collections the number of the rarities always
increased in proportion as a taste for natural history became
more prevalent, and as the extension of commerce afforded
better opportunities for procuring the productions of remote
countries. Menageries were established to add to the magnificence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
of courts, and the stuffed skins of rare animals were
hung up as memorials of their having existed. Public libraries
also were made receptacles for such natural curiosities as were
from time to time presented to them; and as in universities
the faculty of medicine had a hall appropriated for the dissection
of human bodies, curiosities from the animal kingdom
were collected there also by degrees; and it is probable that
the professors of anatomy first made attempts to preserve different
parts of animals in spirit of wine, as they were obliged
to keep them by them for the use of their pupils; and because
in old times dead bodies were not given up to them as at
present, and were more difficult to be obtained.</p>

<p>At a later period collections of natural curiosities began to
be formed by private persons. The object of them at first
appears to have been rather to gratify the sight than to improve
the understanding; and they contained more rarities of
art, valuable pieces of workmanship and antiquities, than productions
of nature. It is certain that such collections were
first made in places where many families had been enriched
without much labour by trade and manufactures, and who, it
is likely, might wish to procure to themselves consequence and
respect by expending money in this manner. It is not improbable
that such collections were formed, though not first, as
Stetten <span class="locked">thinks<a name="FNanchor_891" id="FNanchor_891" href="#Footnote_891" class="fnanchor">891</a></span>, at a very early period at Augsburg, and this
taste was soon spread into other opulent cities and states.</p>

<p>Private collections, however, appear for the first time in the
sixteenth century; and there is no doubt that they were formed
by every learned man who at that period applied to the study
of natural history. Among these were Hen. Cor. Agrippa
of Nettesheim; Nic. Monardes, Paracelsus, Val. <span class="locked">Cordus<a name="FNanchor_892" id="FNanchor_892" href="#Footnote_892" class="fnanchor">892</a></span>,
Hier. Cardan, Matthiolus, 1577; Conrad Gesner, George Agricola,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
<span class="locked">1555<a name="FNanchor_893" id="FNanchor_893" href="#Footnote_893" class="fnanchor">893</a></span>; Pet. Bellon, 1564; W. Rondelet, 1566; <span class="locked">Thurneisser<a name="FNanchor_894" id="FNanchor_894" href="#Footnote_894" class="fnanchor">894</a></span>;
Abraham Ortelius, <span class="locked">1598<a name="FNanchor_895" id="FNanchor_895" href="#Footnote_895" class="fnanchor">895</a></span>; and many others. That
such collections were formed also in <span class="locked">England<a name="FNanchor_896" id="FNanchor_896" href="#Footnote_896" class="fnanchor">896</a></span> during the
above century, is proved by the catalogue which Hakluyt used
for his works.</p>

<p>The oldest catalogues of private collections which I remember,
are the following: Samuel Quickelberg, a physician from
Antwerp, who about the year 1553 resided at Ingolstadt, and
was much esteemed by the duke of Bavaria, published in
quarto at Munich in 1565, Inscriptiones vel Tituli Theatri
Amplissimi, complectentis Rerum Universitatis singulas Materias
et Imagines. This pamphlet contained only the plan of
a large work, in which he intended to give a description of all
the rarities of nature and art. I have never had an opportunity
of seeing it. I am acquainted only with a copious extract
from it, which induces me to doubt whether Walch was right
in giving it out as a catalogue of the author’s <span class="locked">collection<a name="FNanchor_897" id="FNanchor_897" href="#Footnote_897" class="fnanchor">897</a></span>.</p>

<p>The same year, 1565, John Kentmann, a learned physician
in Torgau, sent a catalogue of his collection, which consisted
principally of minerals and shells, to Conrad Gesner, who
caused it to be <span class="locked">printed<a name="FNanchor_898" id="FNanchor_898" href="#Footnote_898" class="fnanchor">898</a></span>. The order observed in it is principally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
borrowed from Agricola. This collection, however, was
not extensive. It was contained in a cabinet composed of thirteen
drawers, each divided lengthwise into two partitions, and
the number of the articles, among which, besides minerals, there
were various productions found in mines and marine bodies,
amounted to about sixteen hundred. It must however have
been considerable for that period, as the collector tells us he laid
out sums in forming it which few could be able to <span class="locked">expend<a name="FNanchor_899" id="FNanchor_899" href="#Footnote_899" class="fnanchor">899</a></span>; and
as Jacob Fabricius, in order to see it, undertook a journey from
Chemnitz to <span class="locked">Torgau<a name="FNanchor_900" id="FNanchor_900" href="#Footnote_900" class="fnanchor">900</a></span>. About this time lived in France that
ingenious and intelligent potter, Bernard Palissy, who collected
all kinds of natural and artificial rarities, and published a catalogue
of them, which he made his guide in the study of natural
<span class="locked">history<a name="FNanchor_901" id="FNanchor_901" href="#Footnote_901" class="fnanchor">901</a></span>. Michael Mercati, a physician, who was contemporary,
formed also in Italy a large collection of natural curiosities,
and wrote a very copious description of them, which was first
printed about the beginning of the last <span class="locked">century<a name="FNanchor_902" id="FNanchor_902" href="#Footnote_902" class="fnanchor">902</a></span>. The collection
of Ferdinand Imperati, a Neapolitan, the description of
which was printed for the first time in 1599, belongs to the
same period; and likewise the large collection of Fran. Calceolari<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
of Verona, the catalogue of which was first printed in
<span class="locked">1584<a name="FNanchor_903" id="FNanchor_903" href="#Footnote_903" class="fnanchor">903</a></span>. Walch and some others mention the catalogue of
Brackenhoffer’s collection as one of the earliest, but it was
printed for the first time only in 1677.</p>

<p>[The <span class="smcap">Tradescants</span>, father and son, are celebrated as being
among the first collectors of rarities in this country, which
they deposited during their lives in a large house situate in the
parish of Lambeth. This became a place of fashionable resort
from the curiosities it contained, and obtained the appellation of
Tradescant’s ark. A catalogue of its contents was printed in
1656 under the title of Museum Tradescantium. In 1659 this
collection was purchased by <span class="smcap">Elias Ashmole</span>, who presented
it, together with his books, MSS., and other rarities, to the
University of Oxford in 1683, thereby commencing the now
celebrated <span class="smcap">Ashmolean Museum</span>.</p>

<p>About the same period, <span class="smcap">James Petiver</span>, still celebrated for
his curious and interesting botanical publications, made extensive
collections of natural curiosities, employing captains, ship-surgeons,
merchants, &amp;c. to bring him whatever they could find
suitable to his museum, at almost any cost. He kept up an
extensive correspondence in pursuit of this object, and eventually
formed one of the finest collections hitherto made in
England. At his death it was purchased by that celebrated
naturalist, Sir <span class="smcap">Hans Sloane</span>, and thus became the foundation
of perhaps the most important collection in Europe&mdash;the
<span class="smcap">British Museum</span>.</p>

<p>Sir Hans Sloane, after having accompanied the duke of
Albemarle to Jamaica as physician, was elected on his return
to this country to succeed Sir Isaac Newton as president of the
Royal Society. He was born in 1660, and died on the 11th
of January, 1752. Having with great labour and expense
during the course of his long life collected a rich cabinet of
medals, objects of natural history, &amp;c., and a valuable library
of books and MSS., he bequeathed the whole to the public on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
condition that the sum of £20,000 should be paid to his
executors, being little more than the intrinsic value of the
medals, metallic ores and precious stones comprised in his
collection. Parliament fulfilled the terms of the legacy, and
in 1753 an act was passed “for the purchase of the museum
or collection of Sir Hans Sloane, Bart. and of the Harleian
collection of MSS., and for procuring one general repository
for the better reception and more convenient use of the said
collection, and of the Cottonian library and additions thereto.”
Such was the commencement of the British Museum, every
department of which has since been vastly augmented. The
printed books alone occupy <span class="smcap">Ten Miles</span> of <span class="smcap">Shelf</span>, and owing
to our connexions with every part of the globe, it vies in the
variety and number of objects of natural history with the most
celebrated museums of the world. The interest taken in these
collections by the public is evident from the number of persons
who visited them from Christmas 1844 to Christmas 1845,
amounting to no less than 685,614.</p>

<p>Nor should we omit to mention the collection of curiosities, &amp;c.
formed by <span class="smcap">James Salter</span>, more commonly known by the name
of Don Saltero. They were exhibited to the public at his Coffee-house,
Cheyne-Walk, Chelsea, which was first opened about the
year 1695. It was a very mixed collection of saints’ bones, models,
carved ivory, and objects of natural history. The following
announcement, printed in the Weekly Journal for June 22, 1723,
may be regarded as containing the most positive and authentic
information concerning this establishment, inasmuch as it appears
to have been sanctioned by the proprietor himself.</p>

year of his age, collected minerals and plants is proved by his Silva
Observationum Variarum, quas inter peregrinandum brevissime notavit.
Walch, in his Naturgeschichte der Versteinerungen, considers it as the first
general oryctography of Germany, and is surprised that so extensive a work
should have been thought of at that period. Wallerius, in his Lucubratio
de Systematibus Mineralogicis, Hohniæ, 1768, 8vo, p. 27, considers this
Silva as a systematic description of all minerals. Both however are mistaken.
Cordus undertook a journey in 1542, through some parts of Germany,
and drew up a short catalogue without order, of the natural objects
he met with in the course of his travels, which was published by Conrad
Gesner, together with the other works of this industrious man, at Strasburg
in 1561. This book, which I have in my possession, has in the title page,

have suffered you to live in your religion amidst fires and massacres: now
I am so strongly urged by the Guise party and by my people, that <i>I am constrained</i>

<h2 id="chimneys">CHIMNEYS.</h2>

<p>Notwithstanding the magnificence of the Grecian and Roman
architecture, which we still admire in those ruins that
remain as monuments of the talents and genius of the ancient
builders, it is very doubtful whether their common dwelling-houses
had chimneys, that is, passages or funnels formed in
the walls for conveying away the smoke from the fire-place or
stoves through the different stories to the summit of the edifice;
conveniences which are not wanting in the meanest of our
houses at present, and in the smallest of our villages. This
question some have pretended to determine without much
labour or research. How can we suppose, say they, that the
Romans, our masters in the art of building, should not have
devised and invented some means to keep free from smoke
their elegant habitations, which were furnished and ornamented
in a splendid and costly manner? How is it possible that
a people who purchased ease and convenience at the greatest
expense, should suffer their apartments to be filled with smoke,
which must have allowed them to enjoy scarcely a moment of
pleasure? And how could their cooks dress in smoky kitchens
the various sumptuous dishes with which the most refined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
voluptuaries covered their tables? One must however be very
little acquainted with the history of inventions and manners,
to consider such bare conjectures as decisive proofs. It is undoubtedly
certain, that many of our common necessaries were
for many centuries unknown to the most enlightened nations,
and that they are in part still wanting in some countries at
present. Besides, it is probable that before the invention of
chimneys, other means, now forgotten, were employed to remove
smoke.</p>

<p>The ancient mason-work still to be found in Italy does not
determine the question. Of the walls of towns, temples, amphitheatres,
baths, aqueducts and bridges, there are some
though very imperfect remains, in which chimneys cannot be
expected; but of common dwelling-houses none are to be
seen, except at Herculaneum, and there no traces of chimneys
have been <span class="locked">discovered<a name="FNanchor_904" id="FNanchor_904" href="#Footnote_904" class="fnanchor">904</a></span>. The paintings and pieces of sculpture
which are preserved, afford us as little information; for nothing
can be perceived in them that bears the smallest resemblance
to a modern chimney. If the writings of the ancients are to
be referred to, we must collect from the works of the Greek
and Roman authors whatever seems allusive to the subject.
This indeed has been already done by various men of <span class="locked">learning<a name="FNanchor_905" id="FNanchor_905" href="#Footnote_905" class="fnanchor">905</a></span>;
but the greater part of them seem to deduce more from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
the passages they quote than can be admitted by those who
read and examine them without prejudice. I shall here present
them to my readers, that they may have an opportunity
of judging for themselves.</p>

<p>We are told by Homer, that Ulysses, when in the grotto of
Calypso, wished that he might see the smoke ascending from
Ithaca, that is, he wished to be in sight of the <span class="locked">island<a name="FNanchor_906" id="FNanchor_906" href="#Footnote_906" class="fnanchor">906</a></span>. Montfaucon
is of opinion that this wish is unintelligible unless it
be allowed that the houses of Ithaca had chimneys. But cannot
smoke be seen to rise also when it makes its way through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
doors and windows? When navigators at sea observe smoke
arising, they conclude that they are in the neighbourhood of
inhabited land; but no one undoubtedly will thence infer, that
the habitations of the people have chimneys.</p>

<p>Herodotus<a name="FNanchor_907" id="FNanchor_907" href="#Footnote_907" class="fnanchor">907</a> relates that a king of Lebæa, when one of his
servants asked for his wages, offered him in jest the sun, which
at that time shone into the house through the chimney, as
some have translated the original; but it appears that what is
here called chimney, was nothing more than an opening in the
roof, under which, perhaps, the fire was made in the middle
of the edifice. Through a high chimney, of the same form as
those used at present, the sun certainly could not throw his
rays on the floor of any apartment.</p>

<p>In the Vespæ of <span class="locked">Aristophanes<a name="FNanchor_908" id="FNanchor_908" href="#Footnote_908" class="fnanchor">908</a></span>, old Philocleon wishes to
escape through the kitchen. Some one asks, “What is that
which makes a noise in the chimney?” “I am the smoke,”
replies the old man, “and am endeavouring to get out at the
chimney.” This passage, however, which, according to the
usual translation, seems to allude to a common chimney, can,
in my opinion, especially when we consider the illustration
of the scholiasts, be explained also by a simple hole in the
roof, as Reiske has determined; and indeed this appears to be
more probable, as we find mention made of a top or covering
with which the hole was closed.</p>

<p>In a passage of the poet Alexis, who lived in the time of
Alexander the Great, quoted by Athenæus<a name="FNanchor_909" id="FNanchor_909" href="#Footnote_909" class="fnanchor">909</a>, some one asks,
“Boy, is there a kitchen? Has it a chimney?” “Yes, but it
is a bad one&mdash;the eyes will suffer.” The question here alludes
without doubt to a passage for carrying off smoke; but information
is not given us sufficient to determine its form and
construction. Athenæus has preserved also a passage of the
poet <span class="locked">Diphilus<a name="FNanchor_910" id="FNanchor_910" href="#Footnote_910" class="fnanchor">910</a></span>, in which a parasite says, when he is invited to
the house of a rich man, he does not look at the magnificence
of the building or the elegance of the furniture, but to the
smoke of the kitchen. “If I see it,” adds he, “rising up in
abundance, quick and in a straight column, my heart is rejoiced,
for I expect a good supper.” In this passage, however,
which according to Maternus is clearly in favour of chimneys,
I can find as little proof as in the words of the poet Sosipater,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
quoted likewise by Athenæus<a name="FNanchor_911" id="FNanchor_911" href="#Footnote_911" class="fnanchor">911</a>, who reckons the art of determining
which way the wind blows to be a part of the knowledge
requisite in a perfect cook. “He must know,” says he,
“to discover from what quarter it comes, for when the smoke
is driven about it spoils many kinds of dishes.” Instead of
agreeing with Ferrarius that this quotation seems to show that
the houses of the ancients were provided with chimneys, I
conclude rather from it, that they were not; for, had there
been chimneys in their kitchens, the cooks must have left the
smoke to make its way through them without giving themselves
any trouble; but if they were destitute of these conveniences,
it would be necessary for them to afford it some other
passage; it would consequently be the business of the cook to
consider on what side it would be most advantageous to open
a door or a window; and in this he would undoubtedly be
guided by the direction of the wind. That this really was the
case, appears from a Greek epigram, which by an ingenious
thought, gives us an idea of the passage of smoke through a
<span class="locked">window<a name="FNanchor_912" id="FNanchor_912" href="#Footnote_912" class="fnanchor">912</a></span>.</p>

<p>These, as far as I know, are all the passages which have
been collected from Greek authors respecting this question.
But instead of proving that the houses of the ancients were
built with chimneys, they seem much rather to show the contrary:
especially when we consider what the Roman writers
have said on the same subject; for the information of the
latter, taken together, affords good grounds to believe that no
chimneys were to be found in the houses at Rome, at least at
the time when these authors wrote; and this certainly would
not have been the case had the Romans ever seen chimneys
among the Greeks. I shall now lay before my readers those
passages which appear on the first view to refute my conjecture.</p>

<p>When the triumviri, says <span class="locked">Appian<a name="FNanchor_913" id="FNanchor_913" href="#Footnote_913" class="fnanchor">913</a></span>, caused those who had
been proscribed by them to be sought out by the military,
some of them, to avoid the bloody hands of their persecutors,
hid themselves in wells, and others, as Ferrarius translates the
words, “in fumaria sub tecto, qua scilicet fumus e tecto evolvitur.”
The true translation however is “fumosa cænacula.”
The principal persons of Rome endeavoured to conceal themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
in the smoky apartments of the upper story under the
roof, which in general were inhabited only by poor people;
and this seems to be confirmed by what <span class="locked">Juvenal<a name="FNanchor_914" id="FNanchor_914" href="#Footnote_914" class="fnanchor">914</a></span> expressly
says, “Rarus venit in cænacula miles.”</p>

<p>Those passages of the ancients which speak of smoke rising
up from houses have with equal impropriety been supposed
to allude to chimneys, as if the smoke could not make its way
through doors and windows. <span class="locked">Seneca<a name="FNanchor_915" id="FNanchor_915" href="#Footnote_915" class="fnanchor">915</a></span> writes, “Last evening
I had some friends with me, and on that account a stronger
smoke was raised; not such a smoke however as bursts forth
from the kitchens of the great, and which alarms the watchmen,
but such a one as signifies that guests are arrived.”
Those whose judgements are not already warped by prejudice,
will undoubtedly find the true sense of these words to be, that
the smoke forced its way through the kitchen windows. Had
the houses been built with chimney-funnels, one cannot conceive
why the watchmen should have been alarmed when they
observed a stronger smoke than usual arising from them; but
as the kitchens had no conveniences of that kind, an apprehension
of fire, when extraordinary entertainments were to be
provided in the houses of the rich for large companies, seems
to have been well-founded; and on such occasions people
appointed for that purpose were stationed in the neighbourhood
to be constantly on the watch, and to be ready to extinguish
the flames in case a fire should <span class="locked">happen<a name="FNanchor_916" id="FNanchor_916" href="#Footnote_916" class="fnanchor">916</a></span>. There are
many other passages to be found in Roman authors of the
like kind, which it is hardly necessary to mention, such as that
of <span class="locked">Virgil<a name="FNanchor_917" id="FNanchor_917" href="#Footnote_917" class="fnanchor">917</a></span>:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Et jam summa procul villarum culmina fumant.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">and the following words of <span class="locked">Plautus<a name="FNanchor_918" id="FNanchor_918" href="#Footnote_918" class="fnanchor">918</a></span> descriptive of a miser:</p>

<div class="poem-container">

<span class="i0">Suam rem periisse, seque eradicarier,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">De suo tigillo fumus si qua exit foras.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">If there were no funnels in the houses of the ancients to carry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
off the smoke, the directions given by Columella to make
kitchens so high that the roof should not catch fire, was of the
utmost <span class="locked">importance<a name="FNanchor_919" id="FNanchor_919" href="#Footnote_919" class="fnanchor">919</a></span>. An accident of the kind, which that
author seems to have apprehended, had almost happened at
Beneventum, when the landlord who entertained Mæcenas
and his company was making a strong fire in order to get some
birds sooner roasted:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Vulcano summum properabat lambere <span class="locked">tectum<a name="FNanchor_920" id="FNanchor_920" href="#Footnote_920" class="fnanchor">920</a></span>.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Had there been chimneys in the Roman houses, Vitruvius
certainly would not have failed to describe their construction,
which is sometimes attended with considerable difficulties, and
which is intimately connected with the regulation of the plan
of the whole edifice. He does not, however, say a word on
this subject; neither does Julius Pollux, who has collected
with great care the Greek names of every part of a dwelling-house;
and Grapaldus, who in later times made a like collection
of the Latin terms, has not given a Latin word expressive
of a modern <span class="locked">chimney<a name="FNanchor_921" id="FNanchor_921" href="#Footnote_921" class="fnanchor">921</a></span></p>

<p>I shall here answer an objection which may be made, that
the word <i>caminus</i> means a chimney; and I shall also explain
what methods the ancients, and particularly the Romans, employed
without chimneys to warm their apartments. <i>Caminus</i>
signified, as far as I have been able to learn, first a chemical
or metallurgic furnace, in which a crucible was placed for
melting and refining metals. It signified also a smith’s <span class="locked">forge<a name="FNanchor_922" id="FNanchor_922" href="#Footnote_922" class="fnanchor">922</a></span>.
It signified likewise, without doubt, a hearth, or as we talk at
present, a fire-place, which served for warming the apartment
in which it was constructed; and for that purpose portable
stoves or fire-pans were also employed. These were either
filled with burning coals, or wood was lighted in them, and,
when burned to coal, was carried into the apartment. In all
these however there appears no trace of a chimney.</p>

<p>The complaints often made by the ancients respecting
smoke serve also to confirm the opinion that they had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
chimneys. <span class="locked">Vitruvius<a name="FNanchor_923" id="FNanchor_923" href="#Footnote_923" class="fnanchor">923</a></span>, where he speaks of ornamenting and
fitting up apartments, says expressly, that there ought to be
no carved work or mouldings, but plain cornices, in rooms
where fire is made and many lights burned, because they will
soon be covered with soot, and therefore will require to be
often cleaned. On the other hand, he allows carving in summer
apartments, where the effects of smoke are not to be apprehended.
The moderns, however, who use chimneys, ornament
the borders of them with carving, painting and gilding,
nor are they injured by the smoke; but we find that among
the ancients, furniture of every kind, ceilings and walls were
soon covered over with soot; and from this even the images
of their ancestors, <i>imagines majorum</i>, were not secure, which,
though they were to be found only in the houses of the great,
and stood in niches in the <i>atrium</i><a name="FNanchor_924" id="FNanchor_924" href="#Footnote_924" class="fnanchor">924</a> or hall, became black with
smoke, and on that account were justly named <i>fumosæ</i><a name="FNanchor_925" id="FNanchor_925" href="#Footnote_925" class="fnanchor">925</a>. The
smoke therefore must have been blown very much about, and
carried into every apartment. In the houses of the opulent,
care in all probability was employed to keep them clean; but
the habitations of families who did not belong to the common
or poorest classes, are represented as smoky and black; and
we are told that their walls and ceilings were full of soot.
They were therefore called black houses, as in Russia the huts
of the common people, which are furnished with paltry stoves,
and which are blackened in the same manner by the smoke of
the fir-wood used in them for fuel, are called black <span class="locked">huts<a name="FNanchor_926" id="FNanchor_926" href="#Footnote_926" class="fnanchor">926</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
As the houses of the ancients were so smoky, it may be
easily comprehended how, by means of smoke, they could dry
and harden, not only various articles used as food, but also
different pieces of timber employed for making all sorts of
large and small implements. In this manner was prepared the
wood destined for ploughs, waggons, and ships, and particularly
that of which rudders were <span class="locked">formed<a name="FNanchor_927" id="FNanchor_927" href="#Footnote_927" class="fnanchor">927</a></span>. For this reason
pantries for flesh and wine, and also coops to hold fowls, which
were said to thrive by smoke, were constructed near the
kitchen, where it always <span class="locked">abounded<a name="FNanchor_928" id="FNanchor_928" href="#Footnote_928" class="fnanchor">928</a></span>; and on the other hand,
it was necessary to remove to a distance from kitchens, apartments
destined for the purpose of preserving such articles as
were liable to be spoiled by <span class="locked">smoke<a name="FNanchor_929" id="FNanchor_929" href="#Footnote_929" class="fnanchor">929</a></span>: but among us the case
is widely different, for we often have neat and elegant apartments
in the neighbourhood of the kitchen.</p>

<p>From what has been said it will readily appear why the
ancients kept by them such quantities of hard wood, which,
when burning, does not occasion smoke. The same kind is
even sought after at present, and on this account we value
that of the white and common willow, <i>Salix alba</i> and <i>triandra</i>;
because when burned in our chimneys, it makes little
smoke, and throws out fewest sparks. The great trouble, however,
which was taken in old times to procure wood that would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
not smoke, clearly proves that this was much more necessary
in those periods than at present. It was customary to peel off
the bark from the wood, to let it lie afterwards a long time in
water, and then to suffer it to <span class="locked">dry<a name="FNanchor_930" id="FNanchor_930" href="#Footnote_930" class="fnanchor">930</a></span>. This process must undoubtedly
have proved of great service, for we know that
wood which has been conveyed by water, in floats, kindles
more readily, burns brisker, and throws out less smoke than
that which has been transported from the forest in waggons.
Another method, much employed, of rendering wood less apt
to smoke, was to soak it in oil or oil-lees, or to pour oil over
<span class="locked">it<a name="FNanchor_931" id="FNanchor_931" href="#Footnote_931" class="fnanchor">931</a></span>. With the like view, wood, before it was used, was hardened
or scorched over the fire, until it lost the greater part of
its moisture, without being entirely reduced to charcoal. This
method is still employed with advantage in glass-houses and
porcelain manufactories, where there are stoves made on purpose
to dry wood. Such scorched wood appears to be that to
which the ancients gave the name of <i>ligna cocta</i> or <i>coctilia</i><a name="FNanchor_932" id="FNanchor_932" href="#Footnote_932" class="fnanchor">932</a>.
It was sold in particular warehouses at Rome, called <i>tabernæ
coctiliariæ</i>, and the preparing as well as the selling of it formed
an employment followed by the common people, and which,
as we are told, was carried on by the father of the emperor
<span class="locked">Pertinax<a name="FNanchor_933" id="FNanchor_933" href="#Footnote_933" class="fnanchor">933</a></span>. When it was necessary to kindle fire without
wood prepared in that manner, an article probably too expensive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
for indigent families, we find complaints of smoke which
brought on a watering of the eyes; and this was the case with
Horace at a paltry inn where he happened to stop when on a
<span class="locked">journey<a name="FNanchor_934" id="FNanchor_934" href="#Footnote_934" class="fnanchor">934</a></span>.</p>

<p>The information which can be collected from the Greek
and Roman authors respecting the manner in which the ancients
warmed their apartments, however imperfect, nevertheless
shows that they commonly used for that purpose a
large fire-pan or portable stove, in which they kindled wood,
and, when the wood was well-lighted, carried it into the room,
or which they filled with burning coals. When Alexander the
Great was entertained by a friend in winter, as the weather
was cold and raw, a small fire-bason was brought into the
apartment to warm it. The prince, observing the size of the
vessel, and that it contained only a few coals, desired his host,
in a jeering manner, to bring more wood or frankincense,
giving him thus to understand that the fire was fitter for burning
perfumes than to produce <span class="locked">heat<a name="FNanchor_935" id="FNanchor_935" href="#Footnote_935" class="fnanchor">935</a></span>. Anacharsis, the Scythian
philosopher, though displeased with many of the Grecian customs,
praised the Greeks, however, because they shut out the
smoke and brought only fire into their <span class="locked">houses<a name="FNanchor_936" id="FNanchor_936" href="#Footnote_936" class="fnanchor">936</a></span>. We are informed
by Lampridius, that the extravagant Heliogabalus
caused to be burned in these stoves, instead of wood, Indian
spiceries and costly <span class="locked">perfumes<a name="FNanchor_937" id="FNanchor_937" href="#Footnote_937" class="fnanchor">937</a></span>. It is also worthy of notice,
that coals were found in some of the apartments of Herculaneum,
as we are told by Winkelmann, but neither stoves nor
chimneys. As in Persia and other countries of the East no
stoves made in the European manner are used at present, and
as it is certain that the manners, customs and furniture of the
early ages have been retained there almost without variation,
we have reason to suppose that the methods employed by the
inhabitants for warming themselves are the same as those used
by the ancients. They agree perfectly with the descriptions
given by the Greek and Roman authors, and serve in some
measure to illustrate them. I shall therefore here insert the
account given by De la Valle, as it is the clearest and most to
the purpose.</p>

<p>“The Persians,” says he, “make fires in their apartments,
not in fire-places as we do, but in stoves in the earth, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
they call <i>tennor</i>. These stoves consist of a square or round
hole, two spans or a little more in depth, and in shape not unlike
an Italian cask. That this hole may throw out heat sooner,
and with more strength, there is placed in it an iron vessel of
the same size, which is either filled with burning coals, or a
fire of wood and other inflammable substances is made in it.
When this is done, they place over the hole or stove a wooden
top, like a small low table, and spread above it a large coverlet
quilted with cotton, which hangs down on all sides to the
floor. This covering condenses the heat, and causes it to
warm the whole apartment. The people who eat or converse
there, and some who sleep in it, lie down on the floor above
the carpet, and lean, with their shoulders against the wall, on
square cushions, upon which they sometimes also sit; for the
<i>tennor</i> is constructed in a place equally distant from the walls
on both sides. Those who are not very cold, only put their
feet under the table or covering; but those who require more
heat can put their hands under it, or creep under it altogether.
By these means the stove diffuses over the whole body, without
causing uneasiness to the head, so penetrating and agreeable
a warmth, that I never in winter experienced anything more
pleasant. Those, however, who require less heat let the coverlet
hang down on their side to the floor, and enjoy without
any inconvenience from the stove the moderately heated air
of the apartment. They have a method also of stirring up or
blowing the fire when necessary, by means of a small pipe
united with the <i>tennor</i> or stove under the earth, and made to
project above the floor as high as one chooses, so that the wind,
when a person blows into it, because it has no other vent, acts
immediately upon the fire like a pair of bellows. When there
is no longer occasion to use this stove, both holes are closed
up, that is to say, the mouth of the stove and that of the pipe
which conveys the air to it, by a flat stone made for that purpose.
Scarcely any appearance of them is then to be perceived,
nor do they occasion inconvenience, especially in a
country where it is always customary to cover the floor with
a carpet, and where the walls are plastered. In many parts
these stoves are used to cook victuals, by placing kettles over
them. They are employed also to bake bread, and for this
purpose they are covered with a large broad metal plate, on
which the cake is laid; but if the bread is thick and requires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
more heat, it is put into the stove <span class="locked">itself<a name="FNanchor_938" id="FNanchor_938" href="#Footnote_938" class="fnanchor">938</a></span>.” I shall here remark,
that the Jews used such stoves in their houses, and the
priests had them also in the <span class="locked">temple<a name="FNanchor_939" id="FNanchor_939" href="#Footnote_939" class="fnanchor">939</a></span>.</p>

<p>Those who have employed their talents on this subject before
me, have collected a great many passages from the Greek
and Roman writers which speak of fires made for the purpose
of affording warmth; but as they contain nothing certain or
decisive, I shall not here enlarge upon <span class="locked">them<a name="FNanchor_940" id="FNanchor_940" href="#Footnote_940" class="fnanchor">940</a></span>. Though one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
or more expressions may appear to allude to a chimney, and
even if we should conclude from them, with Montfaucon, that
the ancients were acquainted with the art of constructing in
mason-work elevated funnels for conveying off the smoke, it
must be allowed, when we consider the many proofs which we
find to the contrary, that they were at any rate extremely
rare. As they are so convenient and useful, and can be easily
constructed upon most occasions, it is impossible, had they
been well known, that they should have ever been forgotten.
Montfaucon says, from <i>caminus</i> is derived <i>chiminea</i> of the
Spaniards; <i>camino</i> of the Italians; <i>cheminée</i> of the French;
and <i>kamin</i> of the Germans; and it seems, adds he, beyond a
doubt, that the name, with the thing signified, has been transmitted
to us from the ancients. Though this derivation be
just, the conclusion drawn from it is false. The ancient name
of a thing is often given to a new invention that performs the
same service. The words <i>mill</i> and <i>moulin</i> came from <i>mola</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
and yet our mills were unknown to the ancients. Guys relates,
that a Greek woman, seeing an European lady covered
with a warm cloak, said, “That woman carries her <i>tennor</i>
about with her.”</p>

<p>Besides the methods already mentioned, of warming apartments,
the ancients had another still more ingenious, which
was invented and introduced about the time of <span class="locked">Seneca<a name="FNanchor_941" id="FNanchor_941" href="#Footnote_941" class="fnanchor">941</a></span>. A
large stove or several smaller ones were constructed in the
earth under the edifice; and these being filled with burning
coals, the heat was conveyed from them into dining-rooms,
bed-chambers, or other apartments which one wished to <span class="locked">warm<a name="FNanchor_942" id="FNanchor_942" href="#Footnote_942" class="fnanchor">942</a></span>
by means of pipes inclosed in the walls. The upper end of
these hot-air pipes was often ornamented with the representation
of a lion’s or a dolphin’s head, or any other figure according
to fancy, and could be opened or shut at pleasure. It appears
that this apparatus was first constructed in the baths,
and became extended afterwards to common use. These pipes
sometimes were conducted around the whole <span class="locked">edifice<a name="FNanchor_943" id="FNanchor_943" href="#Footnote_943" class="fnanchor">943</a></span>, as I
have seen in our theatres. Palladius advises a branch of such
pipes to be conveyed under the floor of an oil-cellar, in order
that it may be heated without contracting <span class="locked">soot<a name="FNanchor_944" id="FNanchor_944" href="#Footnote_944" class="fnanchor">944</a></span>. Such a
mode of warming apartments, which approaches very near to
that employed in our German stoves, would have been impossible,
had the houses been without windows; and it is worthy
of remark, that transparent windows, at the time Seneca lived,
were entirely new. These pipes, like those of our stoves, could
not fail in the course of time to become filled with soot; and
as they were likely to catch fire by being overheated, laws were
made forbidding them to be brought too near to the wall of a
neighbouring <span class="locked">house<a name="FNanchor_945" id="FNanchor_945" href="#Footnote_945" class="fnanchor">945</a></span>, though there were other reasons also
for this regulation. As what is here said will be better elucidated
by a description of the still existing ruins of some ancient
baths, I shall transcribe the following passage from
<span class="locked">Winkelmann:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Of chimneys in apartments,” says this author, “no traces
are to be seen. Charcoal was found in some of the rooms in
the city of Herculaneum, from which we may conclude that the
inhabitants used only charcoal fires for warming themselves.
In the houses of the common citizens at Naples, there are no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
chimneys at present; and people of rank there as well as at
Rome, who strictly adhere to the rules laid down by physicians
for preserving health, live in apartments without chimneys,
and which are never heated by coal-fires. In the villas,
however, which were situated without Rome, on eminences
where the air was purer and colder, the ancients had <i>hypocausta</i>
or stoves, which were more common perhaps than in
the city. Stoves were found in the apartments of a ruined
villa, when the ground was dug up to form a foundation for
the buildings erected there at present. Below these apartments
there were subterraneous chambers, about the height of
a table, two and two under each apartment, and close on all
sides. The flat top of these chambers consisted of very large
tiles, and was supported by two pillars, which, as well as the
tiles, were joined together, not with lime but some kind of
cement, that they might not be separated by the heat. In the
roofs of these chambers there were square pipes made of clay,
which hung half-way down into each, and the mouths of them
were conveyed into the apartment above. Pipes of the like
kind, built into the wall of this lower apartment, rose into another
in the second story, where their mouths were ornamented
with the figure of a lion’s head, formed of burned clay. A
narrow passage, of about two feet in breadth, conducted to the
subterranean chambers, into which coals were thrown through
a square hole, and the heat was conveyed from them by means
of the before-mentioned pipes into the apartment immediately
above, the floor of which was composed of coarse mosaic-work,
and the walls were incrusted with marble. This was the
sweating-apartment (<i>sudatorium</i>). The heat of this apartment
was conveyed into that on the second story by the clay pipes
enclosed in the wall, which had mouths opening into the former,
as well as the latter, to collect and afford a passage to
the heat, which was moderated in the upper apartment, and
could be increased or lessened at pleasure.” Such a complex
apparatus would have been unnecessary had the Romans been
acquainted with our <span class="locked">stoves<a name="FNanchor_946" id="FNanchor_946" href="#Footnote_946" class="fnanchor">946</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
I have, as yet, made no mention of a passage of the emperor
Julian, which is too remarkable to be entirely omitted; though,
at the same time, it is so corrupted that little can be collected
from <span class="locked">it<a name="FNanchor_947" id="FNanchor_947" href="#Footnote_947" class="fnanchor">947</a></span>. Julian relates, that during his residence at Paris
the winter was uncommonly severe; but that he would not
allow the house in which he lived to be heated, though it had
the same apparatus for that purpose as the other houses of the
city. His reason for this was, that he wished to inure himself
to the climate; and he was apprehensive also, that the walls
by being heated might become moist and throw out a damp
vapour. He suffered, therefore, burning coals only to be
brought into his apartment, which, however, occasioned pains
in his head, and other disagreeable symptoms. What apparatus
the houses of Paris then had for producing heat, no one
can conjecture from the passage alluded to. In my opinion,
they were furnished with the above-described subterranean
stoves: but even if these should not be here meant, I cannot
help thinking that the emperor’s relation confirms that they
had not chimneys like ours; for, had the case been otherwise,
the cautious prince would not have exposed himself to the vapour
of charcoal, the noxious quality and effects of which could
not be unknown to him.</p>

<p>Though the great antiquity of chimneys is not disputed,
too little information has been collected to enable us to determine,
with any degree of certainty, the period when they first
came into use. If it be true, as Du Cange, Vossius, and others
affirm, that apartments called <i>caminatæ</i> were apartments with
chimneys, these must, indeed, be very old; for that word occurs
as early as the year 1069, and perhaps <span class="locked">earlier<a name="FNanchor_948" id="FNanchor_948" href="#Footnote_948" class="fnanchor">948</a></span>; but it is
always found connected in such a manner as contradicts entirely
the above signification. Papias the grammarian, who
wrote about 1051, explains the word <i>fumarium</i> by <i>caminus
per quem exit fumus</i>; and Johannes de Janua, a monk, who
about 1268 wrote his Catholicon, printed at Venice, says “Epicaustorium,
instrumentum quod fit super ignem caussa emittendi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
fumum.” But these <i>fumaria</i> and <i>epicaustoria</i> may have been
pipes by which the smoke, as is the case in our vent-furnaces,
was conveyed through the nearest wall or window: at any
rate, this expression, with its explanations, can afford no certain
proof that chimneys are so <span class="locked">old<a name="FNanchor_949" id="FNanchor_949" href="#Footnote_949" class="fnanchor">949</a></span>; especially as later writers give
us reason to believe the contrary. Riccobaldus de <span class="locked">Ferrara<a name="FNanchor_950" id="FNanchor_950" href="#Footnote_950" class="fnanchor">950</a></span>,
Galvano Fiamma or Flamma, a Dominican monk from <span class="locked">Milan<a name="FNanchor_951" id="FNanchor_951" href="#Footnote_951" class="fnanchor">951</a></span>,
who died in 1344 professor at Pavia, and Giovanni de Mussis,
who about 1388 wrote his Chronicon <span class="locked">Placentinum<a name="FNanchor_952" id="FNanchor_952" href="#Footnote_952" class="fnanchor">952</a></span>, and all
the writers of the fourteenth century, seem either to have been
unacquainted with chimneys, or to have considered them as
the newest invention of luxury.</p>

<p>That there were no chimneys in the tenth, twelfth, and
thirteenth centuries, seems to be proved by the so-called <i>ignitegium</i>,
or <i>pyritegium</i>, the curfew-bell of the English, and
<i>couvre-feu</i> of the French. In the middle ages, as they are
termed, people made fires in their houses in a hole or pit in
the centre of the floor, under an opening formed in the roof;
and when the fire was burnt out, or the family went to bed at
night, the hole was shut by a cover of wood. In those periods
a law was almost everywhere established, that the fire should
be extinguished at a certain time in the evening; that the
cover should be put over the fire-place; and that all the family
should retire to rest, or at least be at <span class="locked">home<a name="FNanchor_953" id="FNanchor_953" href="#Footnote_953" class="fnanchor">953</a></span>. The time when
this ought to be done was signified by the ringing of a bell.
William the Conqueror introduced this law into England in
the year 1068, and fixed the <i>ignitegium</i> at seven in the evening,
in order to prevent nocturnal <span class="locked">assemblies<a name="FNanchor_954" id="FNanchor_954" href="#Footnote_954" class="fnanchor">954</a></span>; but this law
was abolished by Henry I., in 1100. From this ancient practice
has arisen, in my opinion, a custom in Lower Saxony of
saying, when people wish to go home sooner than the company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
choose, that they hear the <i>Bürgerglocke</i>, burghers’ bell.
The ringing of the curfew-bell gave rise also to the prayer-bell,
as it was called, which has still been retained in some
protestant countries. Pope John XXIII., with a view to avert
certain apprehended misfortunes, which rendered his life uncomfortable,
gave orders that every person, on hearing the
<i>ignitegium</i>, should repeat the <i>Ave Maria</i> three <span class="locked">times<a name="FNanchor_955" id="FNanchor_955" href="#Footnote_955" class="fnanchor">955</a></span>. When
the appearance of a comet and a dread of the Turks afterwards
alarmed all Christendom, Pope Calixtus III. increased these
periodical times of prayer by ordering the prayer-bell to be
rung also at <span class="locked">noon<a name="FNanchor_956" id="FNanchor_956" href="#Footnote_956" class="fnanchor">956</a></span>.</p>

<p>The oldest certain account of chimneys with which I am
acquainted, occurs in the year 1347; for an inscription which
is still existing or did exist at Venice, relates that at the above
period a great many chimneys (<i>molti camini</i>) were thrown
down by an <span class="locked">earthquake<a name="FNanchor_957" id="FNanchor_957" href="#Footnote_957" class="fnanchor">957</a></span>. This circumstance is confirmed by
John Villani, the historian, who died at Florence in 1348, and
who calls the chimneys <i>fumajuoli</i><a name="FNanchor_958" id="FNanchor_958" href="#Footnote_958" class="fnanchor">958</a>. Galeazzo Gataro, who in
the Dictionary of Learned Men is named De Gataris, and who
died of the plague in 1405, says in his History of Padua, which
was afterwards improved and published by his son Andrew,
that Francesco da Carraro, lord of Padua, came to Rome in
the year 1368, and finding no chimneys in the hotel where he
lodged, because at that time fire was kindled in a hole in the
middle of the floor, he caused two chimneys, like those which
had been long used at Padua, to be constructed, and arched
by masons and carpenters whom he had brought along with
him. Over these chimneys, the first ever seen at Rome, he
affixed his arms, which were still remaining in the time of
<span class="locked">Gataro<a name="FNanchor_959" id="FNanchor_959" href="#Footnote_959" class="fnanchor">959</a></span>.</p>

<p>While chimneys continued to be built in so simple a manner,
and of such a width as they are still observed to be in old
houses, they were so easily cleaned that this service could be
performed by a servant with a wisp of straw, or a little brushwood
fastened to a rope; but after the flues, in order to save<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
room, were made narrower, or when several flues were united
together, the cleaning of them became so difficult, that they
required boys, or people of small size, accustomed to that employment.
The first chimney-sweepers in Germany came
from Savoy, Piedmont, and the neighbouring <span class="locked">territories<a name="FNanchor_960" id="FNanchor_960" href="#Footnote_960" class="fnanchor">960</a></span>.
These for a long time were the only countries where the
cleaning of chimneys was followed as a trade; and I am thence
inclined to conjecture that chimneys were invented in <span class="locked">Italy<a name="FNanchor_961" id="FNanchor_961" href="#Footnote_961" class="fnanchor">961</a></span>,
rather than that the Savoyards learned the art of climbing
from the marmots or mountain-rats, as some have <span class="locked">asserted<a name="FNanchor_962" id="FNanchor_962" href="#Footnote_962" class="fnanchor">962</a></span>.
These needy but industrious people chose and appropriated to
themselves, perhaps, this occupation, because they could find
no other so profitable. The Lotharingians, however, undertook
this business also, and on that account the duke of
Lotharingia was styled the Imperial Fire-master. The first
Germans who condescended to clean chimneys appear to have
been miners; and our chimney-sweepers still procure boys
from the Hartz forest, who may be easily discovered by their
language. The greater part of the chimney-sweepers (<i>ramoneurs
de cheminées</i>) in Paris, at present, are Savoyards; and
one may see there everywhere in the streets large groups of
their <span class="locked">boys<a name="FNanchor_963" id="FNanchor_963" href="#Footnote_963" class="fnanchor">963</a></span>, many of whom are not above eight years of age,
and who, clad in linen frocks, will, when called upon, scramble
up at the hazard of their lives, with their besoms and other
instruments, through a narrow funnel often fifty feet in length,
filled with soot and smoke, and in which they cannot breathe
till they arrive at the top, in order to gain five sous; and even
of this small pittance they are obliged to pay a part to their
avaricious <span class="locked">masters<a name="FNanchor_964" id="FNanchor_964" href="#Footnote_964" class="fnanchor">964</a></span>.</p>

<p>
Eberharti a Weyhe Parergon De Camino. To save my readers the trouble
which I have had in searching for this small treatise, I shall give them the
following information: E. von Weyhe was a learned nobleman of our electorate,
a particular account of whose life and writings may be found in Molleri
Cimbria Litterata, vol. ii. p. 970. In the year 1612 he published Discursus
de speculi origine, usu et abusu, Eberharti von Weyhe. This edition
contains nothing on chimneys, nor is there any thing to be found respecting
them in the second, inserted in Dornavii Amphitheatrum Sapientiæ
Socraticæ Joco-seriæ, Hanoviæ 1619, fol. i. p. 733. But this treatise
was twice printed afterwards, as an appendix to the author’s Aulicus Politicus:
Francf. 1615, and Wolfenb. 1622, in quarto; and in both these editions
may be found at the end, Parergon de camino, inquirendi causa adjectum.
In this short essay, which consists of only two pages, the author
denies that the Jews, the Greeks, or the Romans had chimneys. Fabricius,
in his Bibliograph. Antiquaria, does not quote Von Weyhe, either p. 1004,
where he speaks of chimneys, or page 1014, where he speaks of looking-glasses.

chimney, and not to the roof or ceiling.

It may be here said, that the above passages allude to the hovels of the
poor, which are black enough among us. These are not, however, all so
smoky and so covered with soot both without and within; for though this
may be the case in some villages, the houses of the common people in our
cities may be called dirty rather than smoky. These passages of Roman
authors speak principally of town-houses. The house in which Horace
wished to entertain his Phyllis was not a mean one, for, he tells her a little
before, “Ridet argento domus.” [Black huts or hovels, such as are described
in the above remarks, having merely a hole in the roof, or an open
window for the escape of smoke, are still common in Ireland, and in some
of the less-frequented villages of the Continent. Indeed they are met with
even in England. But in all cases the buildings appear to be very ancient.]</p></div>

It would seem that in the above-mentioned neighbourhood there was no

who has taken the trouble to compare the manners of the ancient and modern
Greeks, I shall here give his account at full length:&mdash;“The Greeks
have no chimneys in the apartments of their houses; they make use only
of a chaffing-dish, which is placed in the middle of the apartment to warm
it, or for the benefit of those who choose to approach it. This custom is
very ancient throughout all the East. The Romans had no other method
of warming their chambers; and it has been preserved by the Turks.
<span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">Λαμπτὴρ</span>, says Hesychius, was a chaffing-dish placed in the middle of a
room, on which dry wood was burned to warm it, and resinous wood to
give light. This chaffing-dish was supported, as those at present, by a tripod;
lamps were not introduced till long after. To secure the face from
any inconvenience, and from the heat of the chaffing-dish, oftentimes
dangerous, the <i>tendour</i> was invented. This is a square table under which
the fire is placed. It is covered with a carpet which hangs down to the
floor, and with another of silk, more or less rich, by way of ornament.
People sit around it either on a sofa or on the pavement, and they can at
the same time put their hands and their feet under the covering, which, as
it encloses the chaffing-dish on all sides, preserves a gentle and lasting
heat. The tendour is destined principally for the use of the women, who
during the winter pass the whole day around it, employed either in embroidering
or in receiving the visits of their friends.”</p></div>

These lines show that the poet had an aversion to cold when enjoying his
bottle, and that he wished for a good fire; but they do not inform us whether
the hearth, <i>focus</i>, had a chimney. We learn as little from the advice
of Cato, c. 143: “Focum purum circumversum quotidie, priusquam cubitum
eat, habeat.” It was certainly wholesome to rake the fire together at night,
but it might have burned either with or without a chimney. Cicero, Epist.
Famil. lib. vii. 10: “Valde metuo ne frigeas in hibernis; quam ob rem camino
luculento utendum censeo.” Cicero perhaps understood under that
term some well-known kind of stove which afforded a strong heat. Suetonius,
in Vita Vitellii, cap. viii.: “Nec ante in Prætorium rediit, quam flagrante
triclinio ex conceptu camini.” As Vitellius was proclaimed emperor
in January, a warm dining-room was certainly necessary. Du Cange in
his Glossarium quotes the word <i>fumariolum</i> from the Paræneticum ad Pœnitentiam
of the Spaniard Pacianus; but the latter takes the whole passage
from Tertullian, who wrote more than a century before. Sidonius Apollin.
lib. ii. epist. i.: “A cripto porticu in hyemale triclinium venitur, quod arcuatili
camino sæpe ignis animatus pulla fuligine infecit.” No one can determine
with certainty the meaning of <i>arcuatilis caminus</i>. A covering made
of a thin plate of metal, or a screen, was perhaps placed over a portable
stove; we however learn, that even where the <i>arcuatilis caminus</i> was used,
the beauty of the dining-room was destroyed by smoke and soot. Ammianus
Marcell. lib. xxv. in the end of the life of Jovian: “Fertur recente calce
cubiculi illiti ferre odorem noxium neqnivisse, vel extuberato capite periisse
succensione prunarum immensa.” This in an apartment where there was
a stove or a chimney would have been impossible.

<p>
The passage of Athenæus, lib. xii. p. 519, which speaks of <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">πύελοι</span>, will
admit of various explanations. Dalechamp thinks that they were the
<i>poëles</i> of the French (something like our stoves). Casaubon says they were
bathing-tubs. This opinion is in some measure confirmed by Suidas, who
gives that meaning to <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">πύελος</span>; and by Jul. Pollux, in whom it occurs in
the same sense more than once. Lipsius however rejects these explanations,
and considers <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">πύελοι</span> to have been <i>thecæ</i>, or vessels similar to those
which in low German are called <i>riken</i>, and which, instead of our stoves,
are much used in Holland by the women, who seldom approach the
chimney.</p></div>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="hungary">HUNGARY WATER.</h2>

<p>Hungary water is spirit of wine distilled upon rosemary, and
which therefore contains the essential oil and powerful aroma
of that plant. To be really good the spirit of wine ought to
be very strong and the rosemary fresh; and if that be the
case, the leaves are as proper as the flowers, which according
to the prescription of some should only be employed. It is
likewise necessary that the spirit of wine be distilled several
times over the rosemary; but that process is too troublesome
and expensive to admit of this water being disposed of at the
low price for which it is usually sold; and it is certain that
the greater part of it is nothing else than common spirit,
united with the essence of rosemary in the simplest manner.
In general, it is only mixed with a few drops of the oil. For
a long time past this article has been brought to us principally
from France, where it is prepared, particularly at Beaucaire,
Montpelier, and other places in Languedoc, where that plant
grows in great abundance.</p>

<p>The name, <i>l’eau de la reine d’Hongrie</i>, seems to signify
that this water, so celebrated for its medicinal virtues, is an
Hungarian invention; and we read in many books that the
receipt for preparing it was given to a queen of Hungary by
a hermit, or as others say, by an angel, who appeared to her
in a garden all entrance to which was shut, in the form of a
hermit or a <span class="locked">youth<a name="FNanchor_965" id="FNanchor_965" href="#Footnote_965" class="fnanchor">965</a></span>. Some call the queen St. <span class="locked">Isabella<a name="FNanchor_966" id="FNanchor_966" href="#Footnote_966" class="fnanchor">966</a></span>; but
those who pretend to be best acquainted with the circumstance
affirm that Elizabeth wife of Charles Robert king of
Hungary, and daughter of Uladislaus II. king of Poland, who
died in 1380 or 1381, was the inventress. By often washing
with this spirit of rosemary, when in the seventieth year of
her age, she was cured, as we are told, of the gout and an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
universal lameness; so that she not only lived to pass eighty,
but became so lively and beautiful that she was courted by
the king of Poland, who was then a widower, and who wished
to make her his second wife.</p>

<p>John George <span class="locked">Hoyer<a name="FNanchor_967" id="FNanchor_967" href="#Footnote_967" class="fnanchor">967</a></span> says that the receipt for preparing
this water, written by queen Elizabeth’s own hand, in golden
characters, is still preserved in the Imperial library at Vienna.
But it has been already remarked by <span class="locked">others<a name="FNanchor_968" id="FNanchor_968" href="#Footnote_968" class="fnanchor">968</a></span> that Hoyer is
mistaken, and that he does not properly remember the account
given of the receipt. It is to be found for the first time,
as far as I know, in a small book by John Prevot, which, after
his death in 1631, was published by his two sons at Frankfort
in <span class="locked">1659<a name="FNanchor_969" id="FNanchor_969" href="#Footnote_969" class="fnanchor">969</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
One may easily see that Prevot mistook this Elizabeth for
St. Elizabeth, the daughter of king Andrew II., who was
never queen of Hungary, but died wife of a landgrave of
Thuringia in 1235. But respecting Elizabeth, the wife of
king Charles Robert, we know from the information of Hungarian
<span class="locked">writers<a name="FNanchor_970" id="FNanchor_970" href="#Footnote_970" class="fnanchor">970</a></span>, that in her will she really did mention two breviaries,
one of which she bequeathed to her daughter-in-law,
and the other to one Clara von Pukur, with this stipulation,
however, that after her death it should belong to a monastery
at Buda. It is not impossible, therefore, that one of these books
may have come into the hands of Podacather’s ancestors.</p>

<p>I must however confess, that respecting this pretended invention
of the Hungarian queen I have doubts; it may be
readily conjectured that this Elizabeth must have been extremely
vain; but when she wished to make posterity believe
that in the seventieth, or seventy-second year of her age she
became so sound and so beautiful that a king, at that time a
widower, grew enamoured of her, we may justly conclude that
she was more than vain&mdash;that she was perhaps childish. I
have taken the trouble to search for the king, then a widower,
who paid his addresses to Elizabeth, but my labour has proved
fruitless. This proposal of marriage must have been made
about the year 1370; but Casimir III., brother of the Hungarian
Elizabeth, reigned in Poland till that year, and was
succeeded by her son Louis, who died after her in 1382; and
the throne then remained vacant for three years.</p>

<p>It is rather singular that the name of aqua-vitæ, and the
practice of distilling spirit of wine upon aromatic herbs, should
be known in Hungary so early as the fourteenth century,
though I will not pretend to affirm the contrary. But I consider
it as more remarkable that the botanists of the seventeenth
century should have spoken of and extolled the various properties
of rosemary without mentioning Hungary water. It
cannot however be denied, that in the sixteenth century, long
before Prevot, <span class="locked">Zapata<a name="FNanchor_971" id="FNanchor_971" href="#Footnote_971" class="fnanchor">971</a></span>, an Italian physician, taught the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
method of preparing rosemary-water: and he has even told
us that it was known, though imperfectly, to Arnoldus de
Villa Nova; but he does not say that it was an Hungarian
invention. It appears to me most probable, at present, that the
name <i>l’eau de la reine d’Hongrie</i>, was chosen by those who in
later times prepared rosemary-water for sale, in order to give
greater consequence and credit to their commodity; as various
medicines, some years ago, were extolled in the gazettes under
the title of Pompadour, though the celebrated lady from whose
name they derived their importance, certainly neither ever
saw them nor used them.</p>

<h2 id="cork">CORK.</h2>

<p>Those who are accustomed to value things used in common
life only according to the price for which they can be purchased,
will perhaps imagine that my subject must be nearly
exhausted when I think it worth my while to entertain my
readers with a matter so inconsiderable. Cork, however, is a
substance of such a singular property, that no other has yet
been found which can be so generally employed with the same
advantage; and before the use of it was known, people were
obliged on many occasions to supply the want of it by means
which to us would appear extremely troublesome.</p>

<p>Cork is a body remarkably light, can be easily compressed,
expands again by its elasticity as soon as the compressing
power is removed, and therefore fills or stops up very closely
that space into which it has been driven by force. It may be
easily cut into all forms; and though it abounds with pores,
which are the cause of its lightness, it suffers neither water,
beer, nor any common liquid to escape through it, and it is
only very slowly and after a considerable length of time that
it can be penetrated even by spirits. Its numerous pores seem
to be too small to afford a passage to the finest particles of
water and wine, which can with greater facility ooze through
more compact wood that has larger or wider <span class="locked">pores<a name="FNanchor_972" id="FNanchor_972" href="#Footnote_972" class="fnanchor">972</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
Cork is the exterior bark of a tree, belonging to the genus
of the oak, which grows wild in the southern parts of Europe,
particularly France, Spain, Portugal and <span class="locked">Italy<a name="FNanchor_973" id="FNanchor_973" href="#Footnote_973" class="fnanchor">973</a></span>. When the
tree is about twenty-six years old it is fit to be barked, and
this can be done successively every eight <span class="locked">years<a name="FNanchor_974" id="FNanchor_974" href="#Footnote_974" class="fnanchor">974</a></span>. The bark
always grows up again, and its quality improves with the increasing
age of the tree. It is commonly singed a little over
a strong fire or glowing coals, and laid to soak a certain time
in water, after which it is placed under stones in order to be
pressed straight.</p>

<p>This tree, as well as its use, was known to the Greeks and
the Romans. By the former it was called <i>phellus</i>. Theophrastus
reckons it among the oaks, and says that it has a
thick fleshy bark, which must be stripped off every three years
to prevent it from perishing. He adds, that it was so light as
never to sink in water, and on that account could be used
with great advantage for a variety of <span class="locked">purposes<a name="FNanchor_975" id="FNanchor_975" href="#Footnote_975" class="fnanchor">975</a></span>. The only
circumstance which on the first consideration can excite any
doubt of the <i>phellus</i> being our cork-tree, is, that he expressly
says it lost its leaves annually, whereas our cork-tree retains
them. In another passage however he calls it an <span class="locked">evergreen<a name="FNanchor_976" id="FNanchor_976" href="#Footnote_976" class="fnanchor">976</a></span>.
This apparent contradiction several commentators have endeavoured
to clear up, but their labour seems unnecessary;
for there is a species of our cork-tree which really drops its
leaves. Linnæus did not think this species worth his notice; but
it has been accurately observed by Clusius and <span class="locked">Matthiolus<a name="FNanchor_977" id="FNanchor_977" href="#Footnote_977" class="fnanchor">977</a></span>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
and its existence is confirmed by <span class="locked">Miller<a name="FNanchor_978" id="FNanchor_978" href="#Footnote_978" class="fnanchor">978</a></span>. As <span class="locked">Theophrastus<a name="FNanchor_979" id="FNanchor_979" href="#Footnote_979" class="fnanchor">979</a></span>,
<span class="locked">Pliny<a name="FNanchor_980" id="FNanchor_980" href="#Footnote_980" class="fnanchor">980</a></span>, <span class="locked">Varro<a name="FNanchor_981" id="FNanchor_981" href="#Footnote_981" class="fnanchor">981</a></span> and others mention a common oak which
always retains its leaves, it appears clear to me that the first-mentioned
author, where he speaks of evergreens, meant our
common species of the cork-tree, and that extraordinary kind
of oak; but in the other passage that species which drops its
leaves in winter.</p>

<p>That the <i>suber</i> of the Romans was our cork-tree, is generally
and with justice admitted. Pliny relates of it, in the
clearest manner, every thing said by <span class="locked">Theophrastus<a name="FNanchor_982" id="FNanchor_982" href="#Footnote_982" class="fnanchor">982</a></span> of the
<i>phellus</i><a name="FNanchor_983" id="FNanchor_983" href="#Footnote_983" class="fnanchor">983</a>; and we find by his account, that cork at the period
when he wrote was applied to as many purposes as at <span class="locked">present<a name="FNanchor_984" id="FNanchor_984" href="#Footnote_984" class="fnanchor">984</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
At that time fishermen made floats to their nets of cork,
that is, they affixed pieces of cork to the rope which formed
the upper edge of the net, and which it was necessary should
be kept at the surface of the water, in the same manner as is
done at <span class="locked">present<a name="FNanchor_985" id="FNanchor_985" href="#Footnote_985" class="fnanchor">985</a></span>. The use of cork for fishing-nets is mentioned
by <span class="locked">Ausonius<a name="FNanchor_986" id="FNanchor_986" href="#Footnote_986" class="fnanchor">986</a></span>; and Alciphron describes so abundant
a capture that the net and the cork floats sunk by the weight.
This use, however, was much limited by the high price of
cork; and small boards of light wood, such as that of the pine,
aspen-tree, lime-tree, and poplar, were employed in its <span class="locked">stead<a name="FNanchor_987" id="FNanchor_987" href="#Footnote_987" class="fnanchor">987</a></span>.
The wood of the <i>Marum arborescens</i> is used as floats in Guiana,
and that of the <i>Hibiscus cuspidatus</i> in <span class="locked">Otaheite<a name="FNanchor_988" id="FNanchor_988" href="#Footnote_988" class="fnanchor">988</a></span>. The
German and Swedish fishermen, and also the Cossacks, use
for the same purpose the bark of the black poplar; but the
Dutch and Hanoverians, who fish on the Weser, employ for
their nets a kind of wood called in Holland <i>toll-hout</i>. It is a
wood of a reddish-brown colour, extremely light, and of a very
fine grain, which the Dutch, who export it to Germany, procure
from the Baltic. At Amsterdam it costs a stiver per
pound; but I have not yet been able to learn what wood it
properly is.</p>

<p>Another use to which cork was applied, according to Pliny,
was for anchor-buoys. “Usus ejus ancoralibus maxime navium.”
These words Hardouin has not explained; and <span class="locked">Scheffer<a name="FNanchor_989" id="FNanchor_989" href="#Footnote_989" class="fnanchor">989</a></span>,
where he speaks of anchors, and what belongs to them, takes
no notice of cork. Gesner, however, has attempted an <span class="locked">explanation<a name="FNanchor_990" id="FNanchor_990" href="#Footnote_990" class="fnanchor">990</a></span>,
but what he says is, in my opinion, not satisfactory.
He certainly could not mean that it was employed to render
anchors lighter. According to my idea, they may be easily
made light enough without cork, and perhaps they can never
be made too heavy. The true explanation of this passage is,
that it was used for making buoys, called <i>ancoralia</i>, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
were fixed to the cable, and by floating on the surface of the
water, over the anchor, pointed out the place where it <span class="locked">lay<a name="FNanchor_991" id="FNanchor_991" href="#Footnote_991" class="fnanchor">991</a></span>.
Our navigators use for that purpose a large but light block of
wood, which, in order that it may float better, is often made
<span class="locked">hollow<a name="FNanchor_992" id="FNanchor_992" href="#Footnote_992" class="fnanchor">992</a></span>. A large cask also is sometimes employed. The
Dutch sailors call these blocks of wood <i>boei</i> or <i>boeye</i>; and
hence comes their proverb, “Hy heeft een kop als een boei,”
he has a head like a buoy; he is a blockhead.</p>

<p>A third use of cork among the Romans was its being made
into soles, which were put into their shoes in order to secure
the feet from water, especially in winter; and as high heels
were not then introduced, the ladies who wished to appear
taller than they had been formed by nature, put plenty of cork
under <span class="locked">them<a name="FNanchor_993" id="FNanchor_993" href="#Footnote_993" class="fnanchor">993</a></span>.</p>

<p>The practice of employing cork for making jackets to assist
one in swimming, is also very old; for we are informed that
the Roman whom Camillus sent to the Capitol when besieged
by the Gauls, put on a light dress, and took cork with him
under it, because, to avoid being taken by the enemy, it was
necessary that he should swim through the Tiber. When he
arrived at the river, he bound his clothes upon his head, and,
placing the cork under him, was so fortunate as to succeed in
his <span class="locked">attempt<a name="FNanchor_994" id="FNanchor_994" href="#Footnote_994" class="fnanchor">994</a></span>.</p>

<p>The most extensive and principal use of cork at present, is
for stoppers to bottles. This was not entirely unknown to the
Romans, for Pliny says expressly, that it served to stop vessels
of every kind; and instances of its being employed for that
purpose may be seen in <span class="locked">Cato<a name="FNanchor_995" id="FNanchor_995" href="#Footnote_995" class="fnanchor">995</a></span> and <span class="locked">Horace<a name="FNanchor_996" id="FNanchor_996" href="#Footnote_996" class="fnanchor">996</a></span>. Its application
to this use, however, seems not to have been very common,
else cork-stoppers would have been oftener mentioned by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
authors who have written on agriculture and cookery, and also
in the works of the ancient poets. We everywhere find directions
given to close up wine-casks and other vessels with
<span class="locked">pitch<a name="FNanchor_997" id="FNanchor_997" href="#Footnote_997" class="fnanchor">997</a></span>, clay, gypsum or potters-earth, or to fill the upper part
of the vessel with oil or honey, in order to exclude the air
from those liquors which one wished to <span class="locked">preserve<a name="FNanchor_998" id="FNanchor_998" href="#Footnote_998" class="fnanchor">998</a></span>. In the passages
therefore already quoted, where cork is named, mention
is made also of pitching. The reason of this I believe to be,
that the ancients used for their wine large earthen vessels with
wide mouths, which could not be stopped sufficiently close by
means of cork. Wooden casks were then unknown, or at least
scarce, as Italy produced little timber, otherwise these vessels
would have been stopped with wood, as is the case at present.
The practice of drawing off wine for daily consumption, from
the large vessels into which it is first put, into such smaller
vessels as can be easily corked, was then not <span class="locked">prevalent<a name="FNanchor_999" id="FNanchor_999" href="#Footnote_999" class="fnanchor">999</a></span>. The
ancients drew off from their large jars into cups or pitchers
whatever quantity of wine they thought necessary for the time,
instead of which the moderns use bottles. It appears to have
been customary at the French court, about the year 1258,
when grand entertainments were given, and more wine-vessels
had been opened than were emptied, that the remainder became
a perquisite of the <i>grand-bouteiller</i><a name="FNanchor_1000" id="FNanchor_1000" href="#Footnote_1000" class="fnanchor">1000</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
Stoppers of cork seem to have been first introduced after the
invention of glass-bottles, and of these I find no mention before
the fifteenth century; for the <i>amphoræ vitreæ diligenter gypsatæ</i>
of <span class="locked">Petronius<a name="FNanchor_1001" id="FNanchor_1001" href="#Footnote_1001" class="fnanchor">1001</a></span>, to the necks of which were affixed labels,
containing the name and age of the wine, appear to have been
large jars, and to have formed part of the many uncommon
articles by which the voluptuary Trimalchio wished to distinguish
himself. It is however singular, that these convenient
vessels were not thought of at an earlier period, especially as
among the small funeral urns of the ancients, many are to be
found which in shape resemble our <span class="locked">bottles<a name="FNanchor_1002" id="FNanchor_1002" href="#Footnote_1002" class="fnanchor">1002</a></span>. In the figure of
the Syracusan wine-flasks, I think I can discover their origin
from these urns. <span class="locked">Charpentier<a name="FNanchor_1003" id="FNanchor_1003" href="#Footnote_1003" class="fnanchor">1003</a></span> quotes from a writing of the
year 1387, an expression which seems to allude to one of our
glass bottles; but, when attentively considered, it may be easily
discovered that cups or drinking-glasses are meant. The name
<i>boutiaux</i> or <i>boutilles</i>, occurs in the French language for the
first time in the fifteenth century; but were it even older it
would prove nothing, as it signified originally, and even still
signifies, vessels of clay or metal, and particularly of <span class="locked">leather<a name="FNanchor_1004" id="FNanchor_1004" href="#Footnote_1004" class="fnanchor">1004</a></span>.
Such vessels filled with wine, which travellers were accustomed
to suspend from their saddles, could be stopped with a
piece of wood, or closed by means of wooden or metal tops
screwed on them, which are still used for earthen-pitchers.
In the year 1553, when C. Stephanus wrote his Prædium Rusticum,
cork stoppers must have been very little known, else he
would not have said that in his time cork in France was used
principally for soles (p. 578). In the time of Lottichius, rich
people however had glass flasks with tin mouths, which could
be stopped sufficiently close without cork; and these flasks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
appear to have been as thin as the Syracusan wine-bottles;
for he adds, that it was necessary to wrap them round with
rushes or <span class="locked">straw<a name="FNanchor_1005" id="FNanchor_1005" href="#Footnote_1005" class="fnanchor">1005</a></span>.</p>

<p>Flasks covered with basket-work must have been common
among the Greeks, if it be certain that <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">πυτίνη</span> signifies a flask
of this kind. It appears indeed to do so, because Hesychius
says it was a plaited wine-vessel, like the baskets which prisoners
were accustomed to make. Suidas, however, states that
it was a vessel woven of twigs, named in his time <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">φλασκεῖον</span>,
from which is derived our word <i>flask</i>. It is probable that
these wine-vessels covered with basket-work were only of
earthenware, as glass ones were at that time costly and scarce.
But I do not think it can be proved that a flask of this kind
was called by the Romans <i>tinia</i>.</p>

<p>In the shops of the apothecaries in Germany, cork stoppers
began first to be used about the end of the seventeenth century.
Before that period they used stoppers of wax, which were not
only much more expensive, but also far more troublesome.</p>

<p>That the use of cork for stoppers was not known in the sixteenth
century may be proved from this circumstance, that it
is mentioned neither by <span class="locked">Ruellius<a name="FNanchor_1006" id="FNanchor_1006" href="#Footnote_1006" class="fnanchor">1006</a></span> nor <span class="locked">Aldrovandi<a name="FNanchor_1007" id="FNanchor_1007" href="#Footnote_1007" class="fnanchor">1007</a></span>, though
they describe all the other purposes to which this substance
was applied. How great the consumption of it is at present,
will appear from the quantity used by the directors of the
springs at Niederselters alone; who in the year 1781 employed
2,208,000 stoppers, each thousand of which cost four florins,
making a total of 8832 florins. They were furnished by a
merchant at Strasburg, who was obliged to take back the
refuse, which he then caused to be cut on his own account
into smaller stoppers, and many of these could be used by the
people at the springs. The experiment also was once made
of causing the corks to be cut on account of the directors of
the springs; but the carriage of the refuse became too dear,
and there was no sale for the stoppers of the apothecary phials
which were made of them.</p>

<p>In later times, some other vegetable productions have been
found which can be employed instead of cork for the last-mentioned
purpose. Among these is the wood of a tree common
in South America, particularly in moist places, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
called there <i>monbin</i> or <i>monbain</i>, and by botanists <i>Spondias
lutea</i>. This wood was brought to England in great abundance
for that use. The spongy root of a North American tree, known
by the name of <i>nyssa</i>, is also used for the same end, as are
the roots of liquorice, which on that account is much cultivated
in Sclavonia, and exported to other countries, and likewise
the black poplar, for its bark is employed by the <span class="locked">Cossacks<a name="FNanchor_1008" id="FNanchor_1008" href="#Footnote_1008" class="fnanchor">1008</a></span>
as stoppers to their flasks, and the <i>Æschynomene lagenaria</i>,
which is used instead of cork in <span class="locked">Cochin-China<a name="FNanchor_1009" id="FNanchor_1009" href="#Footnote_1009" class="fnanchor">1009</a></span>.</p>

<p>[That most useful substance, caoutchouc, now replaces cork
for numerous purposes, and is superior to it in almost every
respect, especially in its greater elasticity, in being subject to
less injury from the action of many substances, and but slightly
affected by moisture or dryness. It also keeps better, and is
not much more expensive. The quantity of stoppers now
manufactured by the Patent Caoutchouc Company is perfectly
astonishing.]</p>

leaves <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">γίνεται ἐν Τυῤῥηνίᾳ</span>:” but the Aldine manuscript and that of Basle
have <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">Πυῤῥηνίᾳ</span>. The latter reading is condemned by Robert Constant and
others: but though the cork-tree is indeed indigenous in Tyrrhenia or
Etruria, I see no reason why <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">Πυῤῥηνίᾳ</span> should not be retained, as it is
equally certain that the tree grows in the Pyrenees, and that it there loses
its leaves according to the observation of Clusius. If, on the other hand, we
read <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">Τυῤῥηνίᾳ</span>, this is opposed by the experience of Theophrastus; for in
Italy, as well as in France and Spain, the tree keeps its leaves the whole
winter through. Stapel therefore has preferred the word <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">Πυῤῥηνίᾳ</span>. Labat,
who saw the tree both in the Pyrenees and in Italy, says that in the
former it drops its leaves in winter, and in the latter preserves them. According
to Jaussin (Mémoires sur les évènemens, arrivés dans l’Isle de Corse.
Lausanne, 1759, 8vo, ii. p. 398) it is in Corsica an evergreen; and Carter
(Reise von Gibraltar nach Malaga, Leipsic, 1799, 8vo, p. 190) says that the
case is the same in Spain, but he expressly adds that beyond the Alps it
loses its leaves in autumn.</p></div>

from Spain, where the latter is called <i>chorcha de alcornoque</i>. It is, without
doubt, originally derived from <i>cortex</i> of the Latins, who gave that appellation
to cork without any addition. Horace says, Od. iii. 9, “Tu levior
cortice;” and Pliny tells us, “Non infacete Græci (suberem) corticis arborem
appellant.” These last words are quoted by C. Stephanus in his Prædium
Rusticum, p. 578, and Ruellius De Natura Stirpium, p. 174, and again
p. 256, as if the Greeks called the women, on account of their cork soles,
of which I shall speak hereafter, <i>cortices arborum</i>. This gives me reason
to conjecture a different reading in Pliny, and indeed I find in the same
edition already quoted, the words <i>cortices arborum</i>. This variation ought
to have been remarked by Hardouin.</p></div>

<h2 id="apothecaries">APOTHECARIES.</h2>

<p>The history of the materia medica is a subject fit to be undertaken
only by physicians like Baldinger, Hensler, <span class="locked">Mohsen<a name="FNanchor_1010" id="FNanchor_1010" href="#Footnote_1010" class="fnanchor">1010</a></span>,
and Gruner, who to an intimate acquaintance with what
belongs to their own profession, have united a knowledge of
every other branch of science. By making this acknowledgment,
I wish to guard against the imputation of vanity, which
I might incur as attempting to encroach on the province of such
learned men. That however is not the case. My intention is only
to lay before the public what I have collected respecting this
subject, because I have reason to flatter myself, that, however<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
trifling, it may be of some use until a complete history be
obtained; and because I may have met with some scattered
information, which, without my research, might have escaped
the notice of abler writers. Whoever is acquainted with such
labour, will at any rate allow that this is possible; and I hope
the following essay towards a history of apothecaries will not
prove unacceptable to my readers.</p>

<p>That the medicines prescribed by the Greek and Roman
physicians for their patients were prepared by themselves is
so well known, that I think it unnecessary to produce proofs
with which no one can be unacquainted who has read Theophrastus,
Hippocrates, and Galen. They caused those herbs,
of which almost the whole materia medica then consisted, to
be collected by others; and we have reason to believe that the
gathering and selling of medicinal plants must have at an early
period been converted into a distinct employment, especially
as many of them being exotics, it was necessary to procure
them from remote countries, which every physician had not
an opportunity of visiting; and as some of them were applied
to a variety of purposes, they were sought after by others as well
as by medical practitioners. Several of them were employed in
cookery and for seasoning different dishes; many in dyeing
and painting, some of them as cosmetics, others for perfumes,
some for ointments, which were much used in the numerous
baths, and not a few of them may have been employed also
in other arts and manufactures. It must have been very convenient
for the physicians to purchase from these dealers in
herbs, such articles as they had occasion to use; but it is probable,
and can even be proved, that these people soon injured
them in their profession, by encroaching on their business.
In the course of time they acquired a knowledge of the healing
virtues of their commodities, and of the preparation they
required, which was then extremely simple: and many of them
began to sell compounded medicines, and to boast of possessing
secrets more beneficial to mankind. To these dealers
in herbs belong the <i>pigmentarii</i>, <i>seplasiarii</i>, <i>pharmacopolæ</i>, <i>medicamentarii</i>,
and others who were perhaps thus distinguished
by separate names on account of some very trifling circumstances
in which they differed, or by dealing in one particular
article more than in another. Some of these names also may
possibly have been used only at certain periods, or in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
places more than in others; and perhaps it would be fruitless
labour to attempt to define their difference correctly. That the
<i>pigmentarii</i> dealt in medicines is proved by the law which
established a punishment for such as sold any one poison through
<span class="locked">mistake<a name="FNanchor_1011" id="FNanchor_1011" href="#Footnote_1011" class="fnanchor">1011</a></span>. The herbs which <span class="locked">Vegetius<a name="FNanchor_1012" id="FNanchor_1012" href="#Footnote_1012" class="fnanchor">1012</a></span> prescribes for the
diseases of cattle were to be bought from the <i>seplasiarii</i>; and
that they sold also medicines ready prepared is proved by the reproach
thrown out by Pliny against the physicians of his time,
that instead of making up their medicines themselves as formerly,
they purchased them from the <i>seplasiarii</i>, without so much as
knowing of what they were <span class="locked">composed<a name="FNanchor_1013" id="FNanchor_1013" href="#Footnote_1013" class="fnanchor">1013</a></span>. That the <i>pharmacopolæ</i>
carried on a like trade appears evident from their name;
but people of judgement placed no confidence in them, and they
were despised on account of their impudent boasting, and the
extravagant praises they bestowed on their <span class="locked">commodities<a name="FNanchor_1014" id="FNanchor_1014" href="#Footnote_1014" class="fnanchor">1014</a></span>. The
<i>medicamentarii</i> do not often occur, but we are given to understand
by <span class="locked">Pliny<a name="FNanchor_1015" id="FNanchor_1015" href="#Footnote_1015" class="fnanchor">1015</a></span>, that they followed an employment of the same
nature; and it appears that they must have been very worthless,
for in the Theodosian code, male and female poisoners are
called <i>medicamentarii</i> and <i>medicamentariæ</i><a name="FNanchor_1016" id="FNanchor_1016" href="#Footnote_1016" class="fnanchor">1016</a>.</p>

<p>It may be readily perceived that these herb-dealers had a
greater resemblance to our grocers, druggists, or mountebanks,
than to our apothecaries. It is well known that the word
<i>apotheca</i> signified any kind of store, magazine, or warehouse,
and that the proprietor or keeper of such a store was called
<i>apothecarius</i><a name="FNanchor_1017" id="FNanchor_1017" href="#Footnote_1017" class="fnanchor">1017</a>. It would be a very great mistake, therefore,
if in writings of the thirteenth and fourteenth century, where
these expressions occur, we should understand under the latter
apothecaries such as ours are at <span class="locked">present<a name="FNanchor_1018" id="FNanchor_1018" href="#Footnote_1018" class="fnanchor">1018</a></span>. At these periods,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
those were often called apothecaries who at courts and in the
houses of great people prepared for the table various preserves,
particularly fruit incrusted with sugar, and who on that account
may be considered as confectioners. What peculiarly
distinguishes our apothecaries is, that they sell drugs used in
medicine, and prepare from them different compounds according
to the prescriptions given by physicians and others. But
here arises a question: When did physicians begin to give up
entirely the preparation of medicines to such apothecaries,
who must now be more than herb-dealers, and must understand
chemistry? And when did the apothecaries acquire an
exclusive title to that business and to their present name? It
is probable that physicians gradually became accustomed to
employ such assistance for the sake of their own convenience,
when they found in their neighbourhood a druggist in whose
skill they could confide, and whose interest they wished to
promote, by resigning in his favour that occupation.</p>

<p>Conring asserts, without any proof, but not however without
<span class="locked">probability<a name="FNanchor_1019" id="FNanchor_1019" href="#Footnote_1019" class="fnanchor">1019</a></span>, that the physicians in Africa first began to
give up the preparation of medicines after their prescriptions
to other ingenious men; and that this was customary so early
as the time of Avenzoar in the eleventh century. Should that
be the case, it would appear that this practice must have been
first introduced into Spain and the lower part of Italy, as far
as the possessions of the Saracens then extended, by the Arabian
physicians who accompanied the Caliphs or Arabian
princes. It is probable, therefore, that many Arabic terms of
art were by these means introduced into pharmacy and chemistry,
for the origin of which we are indebted to that nation,
and which have been still retained and adopted. Hence it
may be explained why the first known apothecaries were to be
found in the lower part of Italy; but at any rate we have reason
to conclude, that they obtained their first legal establishment
by the well-known medical edict of the emperor Frederic
II., issued for the kingdom of Naples, and from which
Thomasius deduces the privileges they enjoy at <span class="locked">present<a name="FNanchor_1020" id="FNanchor_1020" href="#Footnote_1020" class="fnanchor">1020</a></span>. By<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
that edict it was required that the <i>confectionarii</i> should take
an oath to keep by them fresh and sufficient drugs, and to
make up medicines exactly according to the prescriptions of
the physicians; and a price was fixed at which the <i>stationarii</i>
might vend medicines so prepared, and keep them a year or two
for sale in a public shop or store. The physicians at Salerno
had the inspection of the <i>stationes</i>, which were not to be established
in every place, but in certain towns. The <i>confectionarii</i>
appear to have been those who made up the medicines
or <i>confectiones</i>. The <i>statio</i> was the house where they were
sold, or, according to the present mode of expression, the apothecary’s
shop; and the <i>stationarii</i> seem to have been the
proprietors, or those who had the care of selling the medicines.
The word <i>apotheca</i> seldom occurs in that edict; when
it does, it signifies the warehouse or repository where the
drugs were preserved. I however find no proof in it that the
physicians at that time sent their prescriptions to the <i>stationes</i>
to be made up. It appears rather that the <i>confectionarii</i> prepared
medicines from a general set of prescriptions legally
authorised, and that the physicians selected from these medicines,
kept ready for use, such as they thought most proper to
be administered to their patients. A physician who had passed
an examination, and obtained a licence to practise, was
obliged to swear that he would observe <i>formam curiæ hactenus
observatam</i>; and if he found <i>quod aliquis confectionarius minus
bene conficiat</i>, he was obliged to give information to the <i>curia</i>.
The <i>confectionarii</i> swore that they would make up <i>confectiones,
secundum prædictam formam</i>. It was necessary that electuaries,
syrups, and other medicines, should be accompanied with
a certificate from a physician to show that they were properly
prepared. I must acknowledge that the edict alludes here
only to some medicines commonly employed; and I am surprised
that the recipes are not mentioned, if such were then
in use. I have never had the good fortune to meet with the
word <i>Receptum</i> used to signify a prescription in any works of
the above century. The practice of physicians writing out,
almost at every visit, the method of preparing the medicines
which they order, may perhaps have been introduced at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
later period. The book of receipts most in use, by which the
medicines of that time were made up, was the Antidotarium,
which the physicians of Salerno caused to be collected and
translated into Latin from the works of the Arabian physician
Mesues, and from those of Avicenna, Galen, Actuarius, Nicolaus
Myrepsius, and Nicolaus Præpositus, by the celebrated
professor in that city, Nicolaus di Reggio, a native of Calabria.</p>

<p>If it be true that the separation of pharmacy from medicine
first took place in Africa, it is highly probable that the well-known
Constantinus Afer may have contributed to introduce
it also into Italy. This man, who was a native of Carthage,
having learned the medical art from the Arabians, made it
known in that country, particularly after the year 1086, when
he was a Benedictine monk in a monastery situated on Mount
Cassino; and the service which he rendered to the celebrated
school of physic in the neighbouring city of Salerno, is well
known. After his time, the monks in many of the monasteries
applied to the preparing of medicines, which they sold to
the wealthy, but distributed gratis to the poor, and by these
means were much benefited in various respects.</p>

<p>It is well known that almost all political institutions on this
side the Alps, and particularly every thing that concerned
education, universities, and schools, were copied from Italian
models. These were the only patterns then to be found; and
the monks, despatched from the papal court, who were employed
in such undertakings, clearly saw that they could lay
no better foundation for the Pontiff’s power and their own
aggrandizement, than by inducing as many states as possible
to follow the examples set them in Italy. Medical establishments
were formed, therefore, everywhere at first according
to the plan of that at Salerno. Particular places for vending
medicines were more necessary, however, in other countries
than in Italy. The physicians of that period used no other drugs
than those recommended by the ancients; and as these were to
be procured only in the Levant, Greece, Arabia, and India, it
was necessary to send thither for them. Besides, according
to the astrological notions which then prevailed, herbs, to be
confided in, could not be gathered but when the sun and
planets were in certain constellations, and certificates of their
being so were requisite to give them reputation. All this was
impossible to be done without a distinct employment, for physicians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
were otherwise engaged. It was found convenient
therefore to suffer some of the principal dealers in drugs gradually
to acquire monopolies. The preparation of drugs was
becoming always more difficult and expensive. After the invention
of distillation, sublimation, and other chemical processes,
laboratories, furnaces, and costly apparatus were to be
constructed, and it was proper that men who had regularly
studied chemistry should alone follow pharmacy; and that
they should be indemnified for their expenses by an exclusive
trade. These monopolists also could be kept under closer inspection,
by which the danger of their selling improper drugs
or poison was lessened or entirely removed. It would appear
that no suspicions were at first entertained, that apothecaries
could amass riches by their employment, so soon and so easily
as they do at present; for they were allowed many other advantages,
and particularly that of dealing in sweetmeats and
confectionary, which were then the greatest delicacies. In
many places they were obliged on certain festivals to give
presents of such dainties to the magistrates, by way of acknowledgment,
and hence probably has arisen the custom of
sending new-years gifts of marchepanes and other things of
the like kind.</p>

<p>In many places, and particularly in opulent cities, the first
apothecaries’ shops were established at the public expense,
and belonged to the magistrates. A particular garden also
was often appropriated to the apothecary, in order that he
might rear in it the necessary plants, and which therefore was
called the apothecary’s <span class="locked">garden<a name="FNanchor_1021" id="FNanchor_1021" href="#Footnote_1021" class="fnanchor">1021</a></span>. Apothecaries’ shops for the
use of courts were frequently established and directed by the
consorts of princes; and it is a circumstance well-known, that
many of the fair sex, when they have lost the power of wounding,
devote themselves much to the healing and curing art,
and to the preparation and dispensing of medicines. [Such
indeed is the case at present in France, medicines being both
prepared and dispensed by the Sisters of Charity, who attend
the sick at the public hospitals, much to the annoyance of the
chemists and druggists, who have frequently petitioned the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
government to interfere to protect their interests.] Dr. Mohsen
says that the first apothecaries in Germany came from
Italy. This may be probable, but I know no proof of it. I
shall now proceed to give some account of the oldest mention
made of apothecaries, which will serve to confirm what I have
said above.</p>

<p>Of English apothecaries I know nothing more than what
has been stated by <span class="locked">Anderson<a name="FNanchor_1022" id="FNanchor_1022" href="#Footnote_1022" class="fnanchor">1022</a></span>, who says that king Edward III.,
in the year 1345, gave a pension of sixpence a day to Coursus
de Gangeland, an apothecary of London, for taking care of and
attending his majesty during his illness in Scotland; and this
is the first mention of an apothecary in the Fœdera.</p>

<p>Of apothecaries in France no mention occurs before the
year 1484; when they received their statutes in the month of
August from Charles <span class="locked">VIII.<a name="FNanchor_1023" id="FNanchor_1023" href="#Footnote_1023" class="fnanchor">1023</a></span> They received others in 1514
under Louis XII.; in 1516 and 1520 under Francis I.; in 1571
under Charles IX.; in 1583 under Henry III.; and in 1594
under Henry IV. These regulations were renewed and confirmed
by Louis XIII., in the years 1611, 1624, and 1638.</p>

<p>For the most copious information respecting German apothecaries,
we are indebted to Sattler. In the beginning of the
fifteenth century an apothecary’s shop was established at Stuttgard
by a person named Glatz, which, as the only one in the
country, was first sanctioned by the count of Wirtemberg in
1458. In the patent given on that occasion it was said that
Glatz’s ancestors had for many years kept an apothecary’s
shop at Stuttgard, and had furnished it as a proper apothecary
ought. In the year 1457 count Ulric gave to John Kettner,
whom the year before he had appointed to be his domestic
physician, leave also to establish an apothecary’s shop at Stuttgard,
and promised to allow no other in his dominions. The
apothecary received yearly from the count a certain quantity
of wine, barley and rye; but, on the other hand, he engaged
to supply the court with as much confectionary as might be
necessary, at the rate of twelve schillings per <span class="locked">pound<a name="FNanchor_1024" id="FNanchor_1024" href="#Footnote_1024" class="fnanchor">1024</a></span>. Both
these shops seem afterwards to have been abandoned, and the
count and the apothecary to have entertained the same opinion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
that each could renounce his contract when he pleased.
In the year 1468, one Albrecht Mulsteiner, or Altumsteiner,
from Nuremberg, was appointed apothecary, with a promise
that no other private or public shop should be tolerated except
that at Wirtemberg. The patent is almost like that given to
Kettner; but it deserves to be remarked that it contains, in an
additional clause, a catalogue of all the different articles, with
their prices. An apothecary’s shop is mentioned at Tubingen,
under count Everhard, as an hereditary fief, the possessor of
which bound himself to serve as physician and apothecary to
the army in time of war. In the year 1500 duke Ulric of
Wirtemberg allowed one Syriax Horn to establish an apothecary’s
shop at Stuttgard, and appointed him his apothecary for
six years. He was obliged to swear that he would supply
government and all public officers, as well as the duke’s subjects,
with medicines; and the body physician was enjoined
to visit the shop once every year, in order to examine whether
Horn conducted himself according to the regulations laid
down for him, and sold his medicines at the fixed prices. In
1559 four apothecaries were appointed in the duchy, viz. at
Stuttgard, Goppingen, Kalw and Bintigheim, which are still
called the land-apothecaries. At the same period there was
an apothecary’s shop in the ducal palace at Stuttgard, which
the consort of duke Christopher caused to be furnished at her
own expense; and from which the poor received gratis whatever
medicines they stood in need of.</p>

<p>That there were apothecaries’ shops at Augsburg so early
as the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, according to the
conjecture of Von Stetten, has been mentioned already. By
the records of that city it appears that a public shop was kept
there by a female apothecary in the year 1445; and at that
period a salary was paid by the city to the person who followed
that occupation. In 1507 an order was passed that the
apothecaries’ shops should be from time to time inspected;
and in 1512 a price was set upon their medicines, and all
others were forbidden to deal in them.</p>

<p>The antiquity of the first apothecary’s shop at Hamburg,
which belonged to the council, cannot be determined; but it
is with certainty known that one existed there before the sixteenth
century. It was situated in the middle of the city, near
the council-house and the exchange; and had a garden belonging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
to it, in the new town. Before the year 1618 there
was at Hamburg also a private apothecary’s shop. In 1529
a city physician was appointed, and quacks and mountebanks
were then banished. The annual visitation by the city physician
was established in 1557. The oldest regulation respecting
apothecaries is of the year 1586.</p>

<p>Apothecaries’ shops, legally established, existed without
doubt at Frankfort on the Maine before the year 1472; for at
that period the magistrates of Constance requested to know
what regulations were made there respecting the prices of
medicines. In 1489 the city physician was instructed to inspect
them carefully, and to see that the proper prices were
affixed to the different articles. In 1500 all the apothecaries
were obliged to take an oath that they would observe the regulations
prescribed for them; and in 1603 a decree was
passed that no more apothecaries’ shops should be allowed for
twelve years than the four then existing; and yet we are told
that the fourth was first built in <span class="locked">1629<a name="FNanchor_1025" id="FNanchor_1025" href="#Footnote_1025" class="fnanchor">1025</a></span>.</p>

<p>In the police regulations drawn up at Basle in the year
1440, by which it was ordered that a public physician should
be established in every German imperial city, with the allowance
of an ecclesiastical benefice or canonry, in order that he
might exercise his art gratis, it is said, “What costly things
people may wish to have from the apothecary’s shop they must
pay <span class="locked">for<a name="FNanchor_1026" id="FNanchor_1026" href="#Footnote_1026" class="fnanchor">1026</a></span>.” Dr. Mohsen hence concludes that common roots
and herbs were not then sold in the apothecaries’ shops, but
expensive compounds brought from other countries.</p>

<p>The first apothecary’s shop at Berlin, of which any certain
and authentic account can be found in the king’s feudal records,
was established in 1488. At that period the magistrates
gave one Hans Zehender a right to the hereditary possession
of a shop, and promised to allow him yearly, to enable him to
support it, a certain quantity of rye, with a free house, and
engaged also to exempt him from all contributions, watching
and other public burthens, and to permit no other apothecary
to reside in the city. This agreement was confirmed in 1491
by the elector John; and in 1499 the elector Joachim I., on
his coming to the government, gave the apothecary a new patent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
in which his body physician was charged to take care that
the shop should be furnished with proper drugs; that the medicines
for the elector and his court should be made up according
to the prescriptions; and that they should not be charged
too high, contrary to the regulated <span class="locked">prices<a name="FNanchor_1027" id="FNanchor_1027" href="#Footnote_1027" class="fnanchor">1027</a></span>. In the year 1573
there was an apothecary’s shop in the palace for the use of the
court; but Mr. <span class="locked">Nicolai<a name="FNanchor_1028" id="FNanchor_1028" href="#Footnote_1028" class="fnanchor">1028</a></span> conjectures that it was only a portable
one, and consisted of some chests filled with medicines. The
present one was founded in 1598 by Catharine, consort of the
elector Joachim Frederick; but the establishment, as it now
stands, began to be formed in the year 1605, when Crispin
Haubenschmid, the first apothecary to the court, was brought
from Halle to Berlin. Catharine, widow of the margrave
John of Custrin, caused an apothecary’s shop for the use of
the court to be established at Krossen, under the inspection
of her physician Wigands, because there was then no shop of
that kind in the place; and at her death in 1574 she bequeathed
it to the magistrates.</p>

<p>In Halle there was no apothecary’s shop till the year 1493.
Before that period medicines were sold only by grocers and
barbers. In the above year however the council, with the
approbation of the archbishop, permitted one Simon Puster to
establish an apothecary’s shop, in order, as stated in the patent,
that the citizens might be supplied with confections,
cooling liquors, and such like common things, at a cheap rate,
and that, in cases of sickness, they might be able to procure
readily fresh and well-prepared medicines. Puster was exempted
by it from all taxes and contributions for ten years,
but with this proviso, that during that period he should furnish
yearly at the council-house for two collations in the time
of the festivals, eight pounds of good sugar confections, fit and
proper to be used at such entertainments. It stated, on the
other hand, that in future no kind of preserves made with
sugar, or what was called confectionary, or theriac, should be
kept for sale or sold either in the market or in booths, shops
or stalls, except at the annual fair. This apothecary’s shop
was the only one in Halle till the year 1535, when the archbishop
gave his physician, J. N. von Wyhe, liberty to establish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
a new one; but with an assurance, that to eternity, no more
apothecaries’ shops should be permitted in Halle; and this
declaration was confirmed by the chapter. Notwithstanding
the archbishop’s promise, strengthened by that of his clergy,
one Wolf Holzwirth, a skilful apothecary, who returned from
Italy, found means to procure permission in 1555 to establish
a third apothecary’s <span class="locked">shop<a name="FNanchor_1029" id="FNanchor_1029" href="#Footnote_1029" class="fnanchor">1029</a></span>.</p>

<p>In the year 1409, when the university of Prague was transferred
to Leipsic, and every thing at the latter was put on the
same footing as at the former, an apothecary’s shop was also
established, which, as that at Prague had been, was known by
the sign of the Golden Lion.</p>

<p>In the year 1560 there was no apothecary’s shop at Eisenach,
and even in the time of duke John Ernest, who died in
1638, there was none for the court; but the place of apothecary
was supplied by one of the yeomen of the jewellery.</p>

<p>In the year 1598, count John von Oldenburg caused an
apothecary’s shop to be established at Oldenburg for the
common good of the <span class="locked">country<a name="FNanchor_1030" id="FNanchor_1030" href="#Footnote_1030" class="fnanchor">1030</a></span>.</p>

<p>In Hanover the first apothecary’s shop was established by
the council in 1565, near the <span class="locked">council-house<a name="FNanchor_1031" id="FNanchor_1031" href="#Footnote_1031" class="fnanchor">1031</a></span>. The consort of
duke Philip II. of Grubenhagen, a princess of Brunswick, who
was married in 1560, supported at her court an apothecary’s
shop and a still-house, for the benefit of her servants and the
<span class="locked">poor<a name="FNanchor_1032" id="FNanchor_1032" href="#Footnote_1032" class="fnanchor">1032</a></span>. Duke Julius, who came to the government of Brunswick
in 1568, caused apothecaries’ shops to be established in
his territories; and his consort, a daughter of the elector of
Brandenburg, kept, for the use of the poor, an expensive
apothecary’s shop in her palace; and the citizens of the new
Heinrichstadt, near Wolfenbuttel, were allowed when afflicted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
by any epidemic disease, the dysentery, quinsy, scurvy, or stone,
to be supplied with medicines from it free of all <span class="locked">expense<a name="FNanchor_1033" id="FNanchor_1033" href="#Footnote_1033" class="fnanchor">1033</a></span>.</p>

<p>The apothecary’s shop at the court of Dresden was founded
by the electress Ann, a Danish princess, in the year 1581. In
1609 it was renewed by Hedwig, widow of the elector Christian
I.; and in 1718 it received considerable improvement.</p>

<p>Gustavus Erickson, king of Sweden, was the first person in
that country who attempted to establish an apothecary’s shop.
On the 20th of March, 1547, he requested Dr. John Audelius
of Lubeck, to send him an experienced physician and a good
apothecary. On the 5th of May, 1550, his body-physician,
Henry von Diest, received orders to bring a skilful apothecary
into the kingdom. When the king died in 1560, he had no
other physicians with him than his barber master Jacob, an
apothecary master Lucas, and his confessor Magister Johannes,
who, according to the popish mode, practised physic, and prescribed
for his majesty. Master Lucas, as appears, was the
first apothecary at Stockholm. On the 21st of March, 1575,
one Anthony Busenius was appointed by king John apothecary
to the <span class="locked">court<a name="FNanchor_1034" id="FNanchor_1034" href="#Footnote_1034" class="fnanchor">1034</a></span>; and in 1623, Philip Magnus Schmidt, a native
of Langensalz in Thuringen, was chosen to fill that office.
In the year 1675 there were five apothecaries’ shops in Stockholm;
since 1694 the number has been nine. The first
apothecary’s shop at Upsal was established in 1648 by Simon
Wolimhaus, who came from Konigsee in Thuringen, and from
whom the present family of count Gyllenborg are descended.
The first apothecary’s shop at Gottenburg was established
about the same time. Towards the end of the sixteenth century
physicians and apothecaries were invited into Russia by
the czar Boris <span class="locked">Godunow<a name="FNanchor_1035" id="FNanchor_1035" href="#Footnote_1035" class="fnanchor">1035</a></span>.</p>

<p>I shall here take occasion to remark the following circumstance:
at the Byzantine court the keeper of the wardrobe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
as the yeoman of the jewellery at Eisenach in the sixteenth
century, had the care of the portable apothecary’s shop when
the emperor took the field. It was called <i>pandectæ</i>, and contained
theriac and antidotes, with all kinds of oils, plasters,
salves, and herbs proper for curing men and <span class="locked">cattle<a name="FNanchor_1036" id="FNanchor_1036" href="#Footnote_1036" class="fnanchor">1036</a></span>.</p>

<p>[In England, in 1543, an act was passed for the toleration
and protection of the numerous irregular practitioners, who
were neither surgeons nor physicians. It was entitled “An Act
that persons being no common surgeons may minister outward
medicines;” the persons thus tolerated comprehending those
who kept shops for the sale of drugs, to whom the name of
apothecaries was then exclusively applied. On the 9th of
April, 1606, king James I. incorporated the apothecaries of
London and united them with the grocers; they remained so
until 1617, when they received a new charter, forming them
into a separate company under the designation of the master,
wardens, and society of the art and mysteries of apothecaries
of the city of London. It appears that the apothecaries of
London did not begin generally to prescribe as well as to dispense
medicines until a few years before the close of the
seventeenth century.]</p>

<p>I must add a few observations also respecting the earliest
<i>Dispensatorium</i>. It is almost generally admitted that the first
was drawn up by Valerius Cordus, or at least that his was the
first sanctioned by the approbation of public magistrates.
Haller has remarked one older; but it is now known only from
the title mentioned by <span class="locked">Maittaire<a name="FNanchor_1037" id="FNanchor_1037" href="#Footnote_1037" class="fnanchor">1037</a></span>. Cordus however appears
to have first used the word <i>dispensatorium</i> for a collection of
receipts, containing directions how to prepare the medicines
most in use. This book it is well known has been often printed
with the additions of other physicians; but, in my opinion,
<span class="locked">Conring<a name="FNanchor_1038" id="FNanchor_1038" href="#Footnote_1038" class="fnanchor">1038</a></span> is in a mistake when he says that it was improved
and enlarged by Matthiolus. I have in no edition found any
additions of Matthiolus; and the error seems to have arisen
from the christian name of Matthias Lobelius, which stands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
in the title of some editions, because his annotations are
added to them. It is very singular that <span class="locked">Kestner<a name="FNanchor_1039" id="FNanchor_1039" href="#Footnote_1039" class="fnanchor">1039</a></span> also has
fallen into this mistake, who, however, says that the name of
Matthiolus is only in the title, for in the book itself he found
no appearance of his having had any concern with it.</p>

and it is very probable that some of this family had kept a public apothecary’s

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="clocks">CLOCKS AND WATCHES.</h2>

<p>A paper on this subject was read by Professor Hamberger,
in the year 1758, before the Society of Göttingen; but as the
publication of the Transactions of the Society was interrupted,
it was never printed. I however procured the manuscript
from the professor’s son, Secretary Hamberger, at Gotha,
and I here insert it, corrected in a few places, where necessary,
but without any other <span class="locked">alteration<a name="FNanchor_1040" id="FNanchor_1040" href="#Footnote_1040" class="fnanchor">1040</a></span>.</p>

<p>“Weidler<a name="FNanchor_1041" id="FNanchor_1041" href="#Footnote_1041" class="fnanchor">1041</a> and <span class="locked">Chambers<a name="FNanchor_1042" id="FNanchor_1042" href="#Footnote_1042" class="fnanchor">1042</a></span> are, doubtless, both mistaken
when they place the invention of automatous clocks about the
end of the fifteenth or beginning of the sixteenth century.
The latter says, ‘It is certain that the art of constructing
clocks, such as those now in use, was first invented or at least
revived in Germany about two hundred years ago.’ The same
account is given by Weidler, whom Chambers perhaps copied.
But, however flattering this opinion may be to the ingenuity
of the Germans, it is so apparently false in regard to the time,
that one cannot assent to it; nor is it even probable in regard
to the country, though it must be allowed that the art of
clockmaking flourished very much in Germany, particularly at
Nuremberg, about the beginning of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>“As these two authors make the invention of clocks too
modern, others, on the contrary, carry it back to a period too
early. Without entering into any dissertation on the machines
of Archimedes and Posidonius, which are said to have measured
the hours of the day, I shall only observe that a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
writer pretends to have found mention made of a clock
in the third <span class="locked">century<a name="FNanchor_1043" id="FNanchor_1043" href="#Footnote_1043" class="fnanchor">1043</a></span>. In support of this assertion he refers
to the Acts of St. Sebastian, the martyr, where Chromatius,
the governor of Rome, says, when about to be cured by him,
‘I have a glass chamber in which the whole learning and
science of the stars is constructed mechanically, in making
which my father Tarquinius is known to have expended more
than two hundred pounds of gold.’ St. Sebastian answers, ‘If
you have made your choice to keep this whole, you destroy
yourself.’ To which Chromatius replies, ‘How so? do we employ
any sacrificial rights in the construction of an almanac or
ephemeris, when merely the courses of the months and years
are distinguished numerically for every hour; and the full and
new moon is, by means of certain calculations, foreshown by a
motion of the <span class="locked">fingers<a name="FNanchor_1044" id="FNanchor_1044" href="#Footnote_1044" class="fnanchor">1044</a></span>.’ This valuable machine, however, can
hardly be called a clock; for if it had been an automaton, it
would not have required to be moved with the fingers in order
to show the time of full moon. If I understand the author’s
words properly, it was not calculated to point out the hours;
but to exhibit the sun’s course through the twelve signs of the
zodiac, the motion of the rest of the planets, and their relative
situation in every month, or at any period of the year. That
the signs of the zodiac and the planets were represented on
the machine, appears from what follows. St. Polycarp (the
companion of St. Stephen) said, ‘There are the signs of the
Lion, of Capricorn, Sagittarius, Scorpio and the Bull; in Aries
the moon, in the Crab an hour, in Jupiter a star, in Mercury
the tropics, in Venus Mars, and in all those monstrous demons
is seen an art hostile to <span class="locked">God<a name="FNanchor_1045" id="FNanchor_1045" href="#Footnote_1045" class="fnanchor">1045</a></span>.’ But whatever this machine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
might have been, it was of no use to others, or to posterity:
it was broken to pieces by these saints, so that, even allowing
it to have been a clock, the knowledge of it must have been
then lost.</p>

<p>“We find also, that Bernardus <span class="locked">Saccus<a name="FNanchor_1046" id="FNanchor_1046" href="#Footnote_1046" class="fnanchor">1046</a></span> ascribes the invention
of clocks to Boëthius, in the fifth century; but Bernardus
seems to have forgotten what he quoted a little before from
<span class="locked">Cassiodorus<a name="FNanchor_1047" id="FNanchor_1047" href="#Footnote_1047" class="fnanchor">1047</a></span>, respecting the clock of Boëthius, that it determined
the hours <i>guttis aquarum</i>. It must, therefore, have
been a water-clock, and not a clock moved by wheels and
weights. The same Cassiodorus had provided his monks at
the monastery of St. <span class="locked">Andiol<a name="FNanchor_1048" id="FNanchor_1048" href="#Footnote_1048" class="fnanchor">1048</a></span>, in Languedoc, with machines
of the like kind: ‘I am known,’ says he, ‘to have constructed
for you a time-piece which the light of the sun indexes;
moreover another acting by water which marks the hours
both day and night; as frequently upon some days there is no
<span class="locked">sunshine<a name="FNanchor_1049" id="FNanchor_1049" href="#Footnote_1049" class="fnanchor">1049</a></span>.’ We are to understand also, as alluding to such
clocks, what is said by the writer of the life of St. Leobin,
bishop of Chartrain, about the year <span class="locked">556<a name="FNanchor_1050" id="FNanchor_1050" href="#Footnote_1050" class="fnanchor">1050</a></span>, when he tells us,
that to him (St. Leobin) was committed the duty of regulating
the course of the hours and the vigils.</p>

<p>“I come now to the seventh century. In Du Cange’s
Glossary we find the word <i>Index</i>, which is explained to be
the index or hand of a clock, or the small bell which announces
the hours by its sound; and this opinion is adopted
by <span class="locked">Muratori<a name="FNanchor_1051" id="FNanchor_1051" href="#Footnote_1051" class="fnanchor">1051</a></span>. Du Cange quotes in support of his assertion
a monkish work called <i>Regula Magistri</i>, the author of which
is not certainly <span class="locked">known<a name="FNanchor_1052" id="FNanchor_1052" href="#Footnote_1052" class="fnanchor">1052</a></span>, but which <span class="locked">Mabillon<a name="FNanchor_1053" id="FNanchor_1053" href="#Footnote_1053" class="fnanchor">1053</a></span> asserts to have
been written before the year 700. The passages to which he
refers are, ‘Cum advenisse divinam horam percussus in oratorio
index <i>monstraverit</i>.’ (When the index being struck in
the oratory shall have shown that the hour for prayer had
come.) ‘Cum <i>sonuerit index</i>;’ and ‘Cum ad opus divinum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
oratorii <i>index sonaverit</i><a name="FNanchor_1054" id="FNanchor_1054" href="#Footnote_1054" class="fnanchor">1054</a>.’ But Du Cange might have perceived,
had he quoted the whole passage from the fifty-fifth
chapter, that allusion is not here made to a clock; for it is said,
not merely ‘cum sonuerit index,’ but ‘cum sonuerit index ab
Abbate percussus.’ (When the index struck by the Abbot
shall sound). It was a <i>scilla</i> or <i>skella</i>, perhaps only a board;
and <span class="locked">Martene<a name="FNanchor_1055" id="FNanchor_1055" href="#Footnote_1055" class="fnanchor">1055</a></span> seems to understand the word <i>index</i> in the true
sense when he explains it the signal by which the brethren
were called to divine service.</p>

<p>“That machine which was sent as a present to Charlemagne
by the king of Persia, in the year 807, is supposed also
to have been a clock like those used at present; and if we
follow the Chronicon Turonense, one may easily fall into the
same opinion: ‘The king of the Persians sent a time-piece in
which the twelve hours were marked by the performance of a
cymbal and of certain horsemen who at each hour went out
through the windows, and on their return in the last hour of
the day shut the windows as they marched <span class="locked">back<a name="FNanchor_1056" id="FNanchor_1056" href="#Footnote_1056" class="fnanchor">1056</a></span>.’ The description
of it however, to be found in Annales Francorum,
ascribed to Eginhard, shows clearly that it was far different
from our clocks. The author says, ‘Likewise a time-piece
wonderfully constructed of brass with mechanical art, in which
the course of the twelve hours was turned towards a clepsydra,
with as many brass balls which fell down at the completion
of the hour, and by their fall sounded a bell placed under
<span class="locked">them<a name="FNanchor_1057" id="FNanchor_1057" href="#Footnote_1057" class="fnanchor">1057</a></span>.’ It was evidently therefore a water-clock, furnished
with some ingenious mechanism, but having nothing in common
with our clocks.</p>

<p>“About the same period lived Pacificus, archdeacon of
Verona, who is celebrated for having invented a <span class="locked">clock<a name="FNanchor_1058" id="FNanchor_1058" href="#Footnote_1058" class="fnanchor">1058</a></span>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
His epitaph, besides relating other services which he did,
<span class="locked">says,&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Horologium nocturnum nullus ante viderat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">En invenit argumentum et primus fundaverat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Horologioque carmen spheræ cœli optimum,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plura alia graviaque prudens invenit.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Scipio Maffei endeavours to prove, that we are here to understand
a clock moved by wheels and weights; but, in my
opinion, his arguments are extremely weak. ‘This <i>horologium</i>,’
says he, ‘the like of which had been never seen, and
which was different from a sun-dial, because it showed the
hours in the night-time, could not be a clepsydra or water-clock,
for clocks of that kind were not only known to the
ancients, but even to the inhabitants of Italy in latter times,
so that it could have been nothing but a clock like ours.’
But even if we allow, with this learned man, that water-clocks
were known in Italy at that period, it cannot be denied that
they were scarce, and used only by few, as may be evidently
gathered from what is said of these machines by Cassiodorus.
The greater part of the people might have been
unacquainted with them at the above-mentioned time; and
there is no necessity for adhering so closely to the words of
the epitaph, ‘nullus ante viderat,’ as Maffei has done. Besides,
Maffei himself destroys the foundation on which he rests his
opinion; for he relates that a <i>horologium nocturnum</i> was sent
to Pepin, king of France, by pope Stephen II. This appears
from the pope’s own letter; but Maffei is under a mistake respecting
the name, for it was Paul, and not Stephen. The
letter, which may be found in the Codex <span class="locked">Carolinus<a name="FNanchor_1059" id="FNanchor_1059" href="#Footnote_1059" class="fnanchor">1059</a></span>, is dated
in the year 756. Maffei thinks that this machine was of a
construction different from that of a water-clock; but if it
pointed out the hours in the day-time, as well as in the night,
according to his supposition, there is no reason, as Muratori
observes, why it should have been called <i>horologium nocturnum</i>.
In my opinion, we ought here to understand a clepsydra,
or water-clock, such as that used by Cassiodorus for
the like purpose, and which Hildemar recommended in the
ninth century to the monks, who were obliged to observe the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
hours. Hildemar says, ‘He who wishes to do this properly,
must have <i>horologium aquæ</i><a name="FNanchor_1060" id="FNanchor_1060" href="#Footnote_1060" class="fnanchor">1060</a>.’</p>

<p>“That these water-clocks however were then scarce, as
well as in the following centuries, we have reason to conclude
from their being so little spoken of in the writings of those
periods. In the ancient customs of the monastery of St. Viton,
at <span class="locked">Werden<a name="FNanchor_1061" id="FNanchor_1061" href="#Footnote_1061" class="fnanchor">1061</a></span>, written as is said in the tenth century, no mention
of them occurs; and the monks regulated their prayers
by the crowing of the cock; for it is said, ‘Cum lucem ales
nunciaverit, dabuntur omnia signa in resurrectione Domini
nostri,’ &amp;c. I find as little mention of them in the eleventh
century, even in passages where they could not have been
omitted, had they been known. Thus, in a little work by
Pet. Damiani, De Perfectione Monachorum, where the author
speaks of the <i>significator horarum</i>, he does not so much as
allude to a clepsydra. That the reader may know what he
means by <i>significator horarum</i>, I shall here quote his own
words: ‘He could not find time for idle fables, nor hold long
conversations, nor finally could he trouble himself about what
was done by the laity, but always intent on the duties of his
office, always provident, always anxious, he felt a desire to
construct a voluble sphere that should never stop, should show
the passage of the stars and the flight of time. He also had
a custom of singing to himself whenever he wished to have a
notion as to the quantity of time; that, whenever the brightness
of the sun or the position of the stars was obscured by
the weather he might form a certain time-measurer by the
quantity of psalmody he had <span class="locked">accomplished<a name="FNanchor_1062" id="FNanchor_1062" href="#Footnote_1062" class="fnanchor">1062</a></span>.’</p>

<p>“Some ascribe the invention of our modern clocks to Gerbert,
who, in the tenth century, was raised to the pontifical
chair at Rome, under the name of Sylvester II., and who was
reckoned to be the first mathematician and astronomer of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
<span class="locked">time<a name="FNanchor_1063" id="FNanchor_1063" href="#Footnote_1063" class="fnanchor">1063</a></span>. This opinion however is supported only by mere conjecture,
and appears to be false from the account of Dithmar,
who says, ‘Gerbert, on being expelled from his country,
sought the emperor Otho, and after a long conversation with
him, made the time-piece in Magdeburg, constructing it correctly
by taking as guide the polar <span class="locked">star<a name="FNanchor_1064" id="FNanchor_1064" href="#Footnote_1064" class="fnanchor">1064</a></span>.’ No mention is made
here of wheels or weights, and this horologium seems to have
been a sun-dial, which Gerbert fixed up by observing the
polar star. It appears, indeed, that Gerbert was acquainted
with no other kind of <i>horologia</i>; for those who speak of his
book De Astrolabio, in which he explains the method of constructing
dials for various latitudes, produce no further <span class="locked">proofs<a name="FNanchor_1065" id="FNanchor_1065" href="#Footnote_1065" class="fnanchor">1065</a></span>.
Some, according to the testimony of Kircher, consider this
horologium to have been a portable dial, which showed the
hour when properly set by the help of a needle touched with
a magnet; but even this opinion is not warranted by the words
of Dithmar.</p>

<p>“The anonymous author of the Life of William, abbot of
<span class="locked">Hirshau<a name="FNanchor_1066" id="FNanchor_1066" href="#Footnote_1066" class="fnanchor">1066</a></span>, who lived in the eleventh century, and who was a
very learned man for his time, says, ‘Naturale horologium ad
exemplum cælestis hæmispherii excogitasse.’ Though this passage
is so short, that no idea can be formed from it of the construction
of the machine, it is evident that it alludes neither to
a sun-dial nor to a water-clock, but to some piece of mechanism
which pointed out the hours and exhibited the motion of the
earth and other planets. As more frequent mention of <i>horologia</i>
occurs afterwards, and as, in speaking of them, expressions
are used which cannot be applied to sun-dials or water-clocks,
I am induced to think that the invention of our clocks
belongs to this period. In the Constitutiones Hirsaugienses,
or Gengebacenses, of the same William, it is said of the sacristan,
‘eum horologium dirigere et ordinare.’ In the like
manner Bernardus Monachus, a writer of the same century,
says, in the Ordo Cluniacensis, ‘apocrisiarium horologium
dirigere et diligentius temperare.’ The same author, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
Ancient Customs, &amp;c. of the Monastery of St. Victor, at Paris,
written also about the same time, says that the registrar (<i>matricularius</i>),
the sacrist’s companion, ought ‘horas canonicas
nocte et die ad divinum celebrandum custodire, signa pulsare,
<i>horologium temperare</i>.’</p>

<p>“The unequal hours then in use rendered this regulating
of the <i>horologia</i> necessary. The days and the nights consisted
of twelve hours each; but were sometimes shorter and sometimes
longer. The reason of this is explained in the sixty-fourth
chapter of the before-mentioned Customs, where it is
said, ‘From the solstice of summer to the solstice of winter, the
time-piece is regulated thus: as much as that space of night
which precedes the matins gradually increases according to
the increments of the nights through the several months, it,
slowly increasing, makes that space in the winter solstice which
is before matins to that which follows, twice. On the contrary,
from the winter solstice to that of spring it is thus regulated:
it decreases that space which it had got in advance
according to the decrease of the nights through the several
months, until scarcely decreasing, it at length in the summer
solstice passes over in the same time that space which is before
matins and that which <span class="locked">follows<a name="FNanchor_1067" id="FNanchor_1067" href="#Footnote_1067" class="fnanchor">1067</a></span>.’ Such was the regulating
of the <i>horologia</i>, and I much doubt whether it could be
applied to water-clocks.</p>

<p>“These <i>horologia</i> not only pointed out the hours by an
index, but emitted also a sound. This we learn from Primaria
Instituta Canonicorum Præmonstratensium<a name="FNanchor_1068" id="FNanchor_1068" href="#Footnote_1068" class="fnanchor">1068</a>, where it is ordered
that the sacristan should regulate the <i>horologium</i> and make
it sound before matins to awaken him. I dare not however
venture thence to infer, that these machines announced the
number of the hour by their sound, as they seem only to have
given an alarm at the time of getting up from bed. I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
indeed never yet found a passage where it is mentioned that
the number of the hour was expressed by them; and when
we read of their emitting a sound, we are to understand that
it was for the purpose of wakening the sacristan to morning-prayers.
The expression ‘horologium cecidit,’ which occurs
frequently in the before-quoted writers, I consider as allusive
to this sounding of the machine. Du Cange, in my opinion,
under the word <i>horologium</i>, conceives wrongly the expression
‘de ponderibus in imum delapsis,’ because the machine was
then at rest, and could rouse neither the sacristan nor any one
else whose business it was to beat the <i>scilla</i>.</p>

<p>“I shall now produce other testimony which will serve
further to confirm what I have here said of the origin of clocks.
Calmet, in his Commentary on the Regulæ S. Benedicti,
quotes from a book on the usages of the Cistercians, three
passages which I shall give as he has translated them, because
I have not access at present to the original. ‘We read,’ says
he, ‘in chap. 21 of the first part of their Customs, compiled
about the year 1120, that the bells will not be sounded for
any service, not even for the clock, from the mass of Holy
Thursday, to that of Holy Saturday; and in chap. 114, the
sacristan is ordered to regulate the clock that it may strike
and wake him during winter before matins or before the nocturns;
and in chaps. 68 and 114, that when the brethren have
risen too early the sacristan give notice to him who reads the
last lesson to continue it until the clock strikes, or till signal
be made to the reader to leave <span class="locked">off<a name="FNanchor_1069" id="FNanchor_1069" href="#Footnote_1069" class="fnanchor">1069</a></span>.’</p>

<p>“The use of these machines must have been continued
from that period, for we find them mentioned in the thirteenth
century, in the commentary of Bernardus Cassinensis (Bernard
of Cassino) on the unpublished Regulæ S. Benedicti, from
the eighth chapter of which Martene gives the following quotation:
‘But the eighth hour being already come, there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
sufficient interval,&mdash;from the middle of the night, when he
who had care of the clock rose to strike it and to light the
lamps of the church which might have gone out on account
of the length of the night, and to ring the bells in order to
wake the sleeping brothers,&mdash;that he was able to get through
half the eighth hour before the brothers had <span class="locked">risen<a name="FNanchor_1070" id="FNanchor_1070" href="#Footnote_1070" class="fnanchor">1070</a></span>.’ It is said
also in the Chronicon Mellicense, in Du Cange, ‘Some one,
deputed by the superior who had the care of the <i>striking clock</i>,
struck; and also carried light to all the <span class="locked">cells<a name="FNanchor_1071" id="FNanchor_1071" href="#Footnote_1071" class="fnanchor">1071</a></span>.’</p>

<p>“As all arts are at first imperfect, it is observed of these
clocks that they sometimes deceived; and hence, in the Ordo
Cluniacensis Bernardi Mon., the person who regulated the
clock is ordered, in case it should go wrong, ‘ut notet in cereo,
et in cursu stellarum vel etiam lunæ, ut fratres surgere faciat
ad horam competentem.’ The same admonition is given in
the Constitutiones Hirsaugienses.</p>

<p>“From what has been said I think it is sufficiently apparent
that clocks moved by wheels and weights began certainly to
be used in the monasteries in Europe, about the eleventh
century. I do not, however, think that Europe is entitled to
the honour of this invention; but that it is rather to be
ascribed to the Saracens, to whom we are indebted for most of
the mathematical sciences. This conjecture is supported by
the <i>horologium</i>, which, as Trithemius tells us, was sent by
the sultan of Egypt, in the year 1232, to the emperor Frederic
II. ‘In the same year,’ says he, ‘the Saladin of Egypt sent
by his ambassadors as a gift to the emperor Frederic a valuable
machine of wonderful construction worth more than
five thousand ducats. For it appeared to resemble internally
a celestial globe in which figures of the sun, moon, and other
planets formed with the greatest skill moved, being impelled
by weights and wheels, so that performing their course in
certain and fixed intervals they pointed out the hour night and
day with infallible certainty; also the twelve signs of the
zodiac with certain appropriate characters, moved with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
firmament, contained within themselves the course of the
<span class="locked">planets<a name="FNanchor_1072" id="FNanchor_1072" href="#Footnote_1072" class="fnanchor">1072</a></span>.’</p>

<p>“The writers of this century speak in such a manner of
clocks that it appears they must, at that period, have been well-known.
Gulielmus Alvernus, disputing against those who
deny the existence of the soul, after producing various arguments,
thus obviates one which might be used against him.
‘Neither,’ says he, ‘do the motions of those clocks which are
moved by water or weights give you uneasiness, both kinds
of which move but for a short and moderate time, require
frequent repair, the arranging of their parts, and the perfect
skill of the astronomer who has a thorough knowledge of his
art. But in the bodies of animals and vegetables the motive
power is entirely internal, which moderates and regulates the
movements of their parts and renders it in all ways <span class="locked">perfect<a name="FNanchor_1073" id="FNanchor_1073" href="#Footnote_1073" class="fnanchor">1073</a></span>.’
And Dante, the Italian poet, <span class="locked">says<a name="FNanchor_1074" id="FNanchor_1074" href="#Footnote_1074" class="fnanchor">1074</a></span>,</p>

<p>“In the fourteenth century mention is made of the machine
of Richard de Wallingford, which has been hitherto considered
as the oldest clock known. The description of it I shall give
in the words of Leland: ‘Being chosen superior of the monastery,
as he was now enabled by his ample fortune, he resolved
to show by means of some glorious work a miracle not
only of genius, but also of excelling knowledge. He therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
with great labour, with greater expense and with the
utmost art, constructed such a clock as, in my opinion, exists
nowhere else in Europe; whether we observe the course of the
sun and moon, or the fixed stars, again, whether we consider
the ebb and flow of the tide, or the lines together with the
figures and demonstrations various almost to infinity: and
when he had brought to perfection this work so worthy of
eternity, he drew up rules for it, as he was the first man of his
age in mathematical learning, which he published in this book,
lest so excellent a machine should fall into disrepute through
the mistakes of the monks, or should become silent from the
law of its structure being <span class="locked">unknown<a name="FNanchor_1075" id="FNanchor_1075" href="#Footnote_1075" class="fnanchor">1075</a></span>.’ This machine, if I remember
right, was called by the inventor Albion (all by one).</p>

<p>“Clocks hitherto had been, as it were, shut up in monasteries;
but they now began to be employed for the common
use and convenience of cities, though no instance of this is to
be found before the above period. Hubert, prince of Carrara,
caused the first clock ever publicly erected, to be put up at
Padua, as we are told by Peter Paul Vergerius: ‘He caused
to be built at the top of the tower, a clock, in which, during
day and night, the four-and-twenty hours pointed themselves
<span class="locked">out<a name="FNanchor_1076" id="FNanchor_1076" href="#Footnote_1076" class="fnanchor">1076</a></span>.’ It is said to have been made by James Dondi, whose
family afterwards got the name of <i>Horologio</i><a name="FNanchor_1077" id="FNanchor_1077" href="#Footnote_1077" class="fnanchor">1077</a>. In remembrance
of this circumstance the following verses were inscribed
on his <span class="locked">tombstone:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Quin procul excelsæ monitus de vertice turris<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tempus, et instabiles numero quod colligis horas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inventum cognosce meum, gratissime lector.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span></p>
<p>“John Dondi, son of the former, acquired no less fame by
a clock which he constructed also, and which is thus described:
‘In which was the firmament and all the planetary
globes, so that the movements of all the stars were comprised
as in the heavens; it shows the days appointed for festivals
and many other things wonderful to be seen: so great was the
admirable construction of this clock, that after his death no
one knew how to correct it, nor to assign the suitable weights.
At length a skilful artist from France, attracted by the fame
of this clock, came to Pavia, and employed many days in arranging
the wheels, which he succeeded in putting together
in proper order, and gave it the right <span class="locked">motion<a name="FNanchor_1078" id="FNanchor_1078" href="#Footnote_1078" class="fnanchor">1078</a></span>.’</p>

<p>“We are informed by the Chronica Miscella Bononiensis,
that the first clock at Bologna was fixed up in the year 1356:
‘On the 8th day of April the great bell of the tower, which
was in the palace called della Biada, belonging to Giovanni, lord
of Bologna, was removed; and was conveyed into the Corte del
Capitano, and was drawn up and placed on the tower del Capitano
on Holy Wednesday; and this was the first clock which
the state of Bologna ever possessed, and it began to strike on
the 19th of May, which Messer Giovanni caused it to <span class="locked">do<a name="FNanchor_1079" id="FNanchor_1079" href="#Footnote_1079" class="fnanchor">1079</a></span>.’</p>

<p>“Some time after the year 1364, Charles V., surnamed the
Wise, king of France, caused a large clock to be placed in the
tower of his palace, by Henry de <span class="locked">Wyck<a name="FNanchor_1080" id="FNanchor_1080" href="#Footnote_1080" class="fnanchor">1080</a></span>, whom he invited
from Germany, because there was then at Paris no artist of
that kind, and to whom he allowed a salary of six sols per day,
with free lodging in the tower.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
“Towards the end of the century, about the year 1370,
Strasburg also had a clock, a description of which is given by
Conrad <span class="locked">Dasypodius<a name="FNanchor_1081" id="FNanchor_1081" href="#Footnote_1081" class="fnanchor">1081</a></span>.</p>

<p>“Courtray, about the same period, was celebrated for its
clock, which was carried away by the duke of Burgundy, in
the year 1382. This circumstance is thus related by Froissart,
a contemporary writer: ‘The duke of Burgundy took away a
clock (which struck the hours), one of the best to be found,
either here or beyond the sea: and he caused this clock to be
taken to pieces and placed upon carriages and the bell also. This
clock was conveyed to the town of Dijon in Burgundy; and
was there put together again and set up; and there it strikes
the four-and-twenty hours in the course of day and <span class="locked">night<a name="FNanchor_1082" id="FNanchor_1082" href="#Footnote_1082" class="fnanchor">1082</a></span>.’</p>

<p>“We are told by <span class="locked">Lehmann<a name="FNanchor_1083" id="FNanchor_1083" href="#Footnote_1083" class="fnanchor">1083</a></span>, that a public clock was put
up at Spire in the year 1395. ‘That year,’ says he, ‘the
clock was erected on the Altburg gate. The bell for calling
the people together to divine worship was cast by a bell-founder
from Strasburg.&mdash;The works of the clock cost fifty-one
florins.’</p>

<p>“The greater part however of the principal cities of Europe
were at this period without striking clocks, which could
not be procured but at a great expense. Of this we have an
instance in the city of Auxerre. In the year 1483, the magistrates
resolved to cause a clock to be constructed; but as
it would cost a larger sum of money than they thought they
had a right to dispose of by their own authority, they applied
to Charles VIII. to request leave to employ a certain part of
the public funds for that purpose.</p>

<p>“The great clock in the church of the Virgin Mary at Nuremberg
was erected in the year 1462.</p>

<p>“A public clock was put up at Venice in the year <span class="locked">1497<a name="FNanchor_1084" id="FNanchor_1084" href="#Footnote_1084" class="fnanchor">1084</a></span>.</p>

<p>“In the same century an excellent clock, which is described
in a letter of <span class="locked">Politian<a name="FNanchor_1085" id="FNanchor_1085" href="#Footnote_1085" class="fnanchor">1085</a></span> to Francis Casa, in the year 1484, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
constructed by one Lorenzo, a Florentine, for Cosmo I. of
Medici.</p>

<p>“Towards the end of this century clocks began to be in use
among private persons. This appears from a letter of Ambrosius
Camaldulensis to Nicolaus, a learned man of Florence:
‘When I received your letter I immediately made
ready your clock, and should have sent it had any one been at
hand to have taken it. I have caused it to be cleaned, for it was
full of dust, and thus as it could not go freely it was retarded;
and because it could not thus run correctly, I gave it to that
illustrious youth Angelo, who is most skilful in these <span class="locked">things<a name="FNanchor_1086" id="FNanchor_1086" href="#Footnote_1086" class="fnanchor">1086</a></span>.’</p>

<p>“About this period also, mention is made of watches.
Among the Italian poems of Gaspar Visconti, there is a sonnet
with the following title: ‘Si fanno certi orologii piccioli
e portativi, che non poco di artificio sempre lavorano, mostrando
le ore, e molti corsi de pianeti, e le feste, sonando
quando il tempo lo ricerca. Questo sonetto è facto in persona
de uno inamorato, che, guardando uno delli predicti
orologii, compara se stesso a quello, &amp;c.’<a name="FNanchor_1087" id="FNanchor_1087" href="#Footnote_1087" class="fnanchor">1087</a></p>

<p>“It appears, therefore, that Doppelmayer is mistaken when
he says that watches were invented by Peter Hele, at Nuremberg,
in the sixteenth century; and that because they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
shaped like an egg, they were called <i>Nuremberg animated
eggs</i>. I. Cocleus, in his Description of Germany, speaking
of this Hele, says, ‘This young man has performed works
which the most skilful mathematicians may admire. For he
makes small watches of steel with numerous wheels, which, as
they move without any weight, both point out and strike forty
hours, even though they are contained in the bosom or in the
<span class="locked">pocket<a name="FNanchor_1088" id="FNanchor_1088" href="#Footnote_1088" class="fnanchor">1088</a></span>.’”</p>

<p>The term <i>Horologia</i> occurs very early in different parts of
Europe; but as this word, in old times, signified dials as well
as clocks, nothing decisive can be inferred from it, unless it
can be shown by concomitant circumstances or expressions,
that it relates to a clock rather than a dial. Dante seems to be
the first author who hath introduced the mention of an <i>orologio</i>
that struck the hour, and which consequently cannot be a dial,
in the following <span class="locked">lines:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Indi come horologio che <i>ne chiami</i>,<br /></span>

</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Dante was born in 1265, and died in 1321, aged fifty-seven;
striking-clocks therefore could not have been very uncommon
in Italy, at the latter end of the thirteenth century or the beginning
of the fourteenth.</p>

<p>But the use of clocks was not confined to Italy at this
period; for we had an artist in England about the same time,
who furnished the famous clock-house near Westminster Hall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
with a clock to be heard by the courts of law, out of a fine
imposed on the Chief Justice of the King’s Bench, in the sixteenth
year of Edward I., or in <span class="locked">1288<a name="FNanchor_1091" id="FNanchor_1091" href="#Footnote_1091" class="fnanchor">1091</a></span>. Blackstone in his
Commentaries has observed, that this punishment of Radulphus
de Hengham is first taken notice of in the Year <span class="locked">Book<a name="FNanchor_1092" id="FNanchor_1092" href="#Footnote_1092" class="fnanchor">1092</a></span>,
during the reign of Richard III., where indeed no mention is
made of a clock being thus paid for; but if the circumstances
stated in the report of this case are considered, it was highly
unnecessary, and perhaps improper, to have alluded to this
application of the Chief Justice’s fine.</p>

<p>It appears by the Year Book, that Richard III. had closeted
the judges in the <i>Inner</i> Star Chamber, to take their opinions
upon three points of law; the second of which was, “Whether
a justice of the peace, who had enrolled an indictment,
which had been negatived by the grand-jury, amongst the
<i>true bills</i>, might be punished for this abuse of his office.” On
this question a diversity of opinion arose amongst the judges,
some of whom supposed that a magistrate could not be prosecuted
for what he might have done, whilst others contended
that he might, and cited the case of Hengham, who was fined
eight hundred marks for making an alteration in a record, by
which a poor defendant was to pay only six shillings and
eightpence, instead of thirteen shillings and fourpence. Thus
far the answer of the judges to the question was strictly proper;
but the application of the fine to build a clock-house
was not the least <span class="locked">material<a name="FNanchor_1093" id="FNanchor_1093" href="#Footnote_1093" class="fnanchor">1093</a></span>; besides, that it was probably a
most notorious fact to every student, upon his first attending
Westminster-hall, as we find judge Southcote, so much later,
in the early part of queen Elizabeth’s reign, not only mentioning
the tradition, but that the clock still continued there,
which had been furnished out of the Chief Justice’s <span class="locked">fine<a name="FNanchor_1094" id="FNanchor_1094" href="#Footnote_1094" class="fnanchor">1094</a></span>.
Sir Edward Coke likewise adds, that the eight hundred marks
were actually entered on the roll, so that it is highly probable
he had himself seen the <span class="locked">record<a name="FNanchor_1095" id="FNanchor_1095" href="#Footnote_1095" class="fnanchor">1095</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
But we have remaining to this day some degree of evidence,
not only of the existence of such a clock, but that it is
of the antiquity already ascribed to it, viz. the reign of Edward
I. On the side of New Palace-yard, which is opposite
to Westminster-hall, and in the second pediment of the new
buildings from the Thames, a dial is inserted with this remarkable
motto upon it, “<i>Discite justitiam moniti</i>,” which seems
most clearly to relate to the fine imposed on Radulphus de
Hengham being applied to the paying for a clock. But it
may be said that this inscription is on a dial and not upon a
clock; which though it appears upon the first stating it to be
a most material objection, yet I conceive it may receive the
following satisfactory answer. The original clock of Edward
the First’s reign was probably a very indifferent one, but from
its great antiquity, and the tradition attending it, was still
permitted to remain till the time of queen Elizabeth, according
to the authorities already cited. After this, being quite
decayed, a dial might have been substituted and placed upon
the same clock-house, borrowing its very singular motto;
which whether originally applied in the time of Edward I. or
in later reigns, most plainly alludes to Hengham’s punishment
for altering a record. It should also be mentioned that this
dial seems to have been placed exactly where the clock-house
stood according to <span class="locked">Strype<a name="FNanchor_1096" id="FNanchor_1096" href="#Footnote_1096" class="fnanchor">1096</a></span>.</p>

<p>Mr. Norris, secretary to the Society of Antiquaries, hath
been likewise so obliging as to refer me to the following instance
of a very ancient clock in the same century: <i>Anno
1292, novum orologium magnum in ecclesia</i> (Cantuariensi),
<i>pretium 30l.</i><a name="FNanchor_1097" id="FNanchor_1097" href="#Footnote_1097" class="fnanchor">1097</a>.</p>

<p>I shall now produce a proof, that not only clocks but watches
were made in the beginning of the fourteenth century. Seven
or eight years ago, some labourers were employed at Bruce
Castle, in Fifeshire, where they found a watch, together with
some coin, both of which they disposed of to a shopkeeper of
St. Andrews, who sent the watch to his brother in London,
considering it as a curious piece of antiquity. The outer case
is silver, raised in rather a handsome pattern over a ground of
blue enamel; and I think I can distinguish a cypher of R. B.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
at each corner of the enchased work. On the dial-plate is
written <i>Robertus B. Rex Scotorum</i>, and over it is a convex
transparent horn, instead of the glasses which we use at present.
Now <i>Robertus B. Rex Scotorum</i> can be no other king
of Scotland than Robert Bruce, who began his reign in 1305,
and died in 1328; for the Christian name of Baliol, who succeeded
him, was Edward; nor can <i>Robertus B.</i> be applied to
any later Scottish king. This very singular watch is not of a
larger size than those which are now in common use; at which
I was much surprised till I had seen several of the sixteenth
century in the collection of Sir Ashton Lever and Mr. Ingham
Forster, which were considerably smaller.</p>

<p>As I mean to deduce the progress of the art of clock-making
in a regular chronological series, the next mention I find
of <i>horologia</i> is in Rymer’s Fœdera, where there is a protection
of Edward III., in the year 1368, to three Dutchmen, who
were <i>Orlogiers</i>. The title of this protection is, “De horologiorum
artificio exercendo;” and I hope to have sufficiently
proved that there was no necessity of procuring mere dial-makers
at this time.</p>

<p>Clock-makers however were really wanted at this period
of the fourteenth century, as may be inferred from the following
lines of Chaucer, when he speaks of a cock’s <span class="locked">crowing:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Full sikerer was his crowing in his loge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As is a <i>clock</i>, or any abbey <span class="locked">orloge<a name="FNanchor_1098" id="FNanchor_1098" href="#Footnote_1098" class="fnanchor">1098</a></span>:<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">by which, as I conceive at least, our old poet means to say,
that the crowing was as certain as a <i>bell</i> or abbey-<i>clock</i><a name="FNanchor_1099" id="FNanchor_1099" href="#Footnote_1099" class="fnanchor">1099</a>. For
though we at present ask so often, “What is it <i>o’clock?</i>”
meaning the time-measurer, yet I should rather suppose, that
in the fourteenth century the term <i>clock</i> was often applied to
a <i>bell</i> which was rung at certain periods, determined by an
hour-glass or a sun-dial. Nor have I been able to stumble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
upon any passage which alludes to a clock, by that name,
earlier than the thirteenth year of the reign of Henry <span class="locked">VIII.<a name="FNanchor_1100" id="FNanchor_1100" href="#Footnote_1100" class="fnanchor">1100</a></span>
The abbey <i>orloge</i> (or clock) however must have been not uncommon
when Chaucer wrote these lines; and from clocks
beginning to be in use we might have had occasion for more
artificers in this branch, though it should seem that we had
Englishmen, who pretended at least to understand it, because
the protection of Edward III. above-cited, directs that the
persons to whom it was granted, should not be molested whilst
they were thus employed.</p>

<p>I now pass on to a famous astronomical clock, made by one
of our countrymen in the reign of Richard II., the account of
which I have extracted from Leland. Richard of Wallingford
was son of a smith, who lived at that town, and who, from his
learning and ingenuity, became abbot of St. Albans. Leland,
speaking of him, says, “Cum jam per amplas licebat fortunas,
voluit illustri aliquo opere, non modo ingenii, verum
etiam eruditionis, ac artis excellentis, miraculum ostendere.
Ergo talem <i>horologii</i> fabricam magno labore, majore sumtu,
arte vero maxima, compegit, qualem non habet tota Europa,
<i>mea opinione</i>, secundam, sive quis cursum solis ac lunæ, seu
fixa sidera notet, sive iterum maris incrementa et <span class="locked">decrementa<a name="FNanchor_1101" id="FNanchor_1101" href="#Footnote_1101" class="fnanchor">1101</a></span>.”
Richard of Wallingford wrote also a treatise on this clock,
“Ne tam insignis machina vilesceret errore monachorum, aut
incognito structuræ ordine silesceret.” From what hath been
above stated, it appears that this astronomical clock continued
to go in Leland’s time, who was born at the latter end of
Henry VII.’s reign, and who speaks of a tradition, that this
famous piece of mechanism was called <i>Albion</i> by the inventor.</p>

<p>Having thus endeavoured to prove that clocks were made
in England from the time of Edward I. to that of Richard II.,
it is not essential to my principal purpose to deduce them
lower through the successive reigns; but when I have shortly
stated what I happened to have found with regard to this useful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
invention in other parts of Europe, I shall attempt to show
why they were not more common in the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries.</p>

<p>The citation from Dante, which I have before relied upon,
shows that they were not unknown in Italy during that period;
and M. Falconet, in Mémoires de Litterature, informs us,
that a James Dondi, in the fourteenth century, assumed from
a clock made by him for the tower of a palace, the name of
<i>Horologius</i>, which was afterwards borne by his descendants.</p>

<p>In France, or what is now so called, Froissart mentions,
that during the year 1332, Philip the Hardy, duke of Burgundy,
removed from Courtray to his capital at Dijon a
famous clock which struck the hours, and was remarkable for
its <span class="locked">mechanism<a name="FNanchor_1102" id="FNanchor_1102" href="#Footnote_1102" class="fnanchor">1102</a></span>. The great clock at Paris was put up in the
year 1370, during the reign of Charles V., having been made
by Charles de <span class="locked">Wic<a name="FNanchor_1103" id="FNanchor_1103" href="#Footnote_1103" class="fnanchor">1103</a></span> a German. Carpentier, in his supplement
to Du Cange, cites a decision of the parliament of Paris
in the year 1413, in which Henry Bye, one of the parties, is
styled <i>Gubernator Horologii palatii nostri Parisiis</i><a name="FNanchor_1104" id="FNanchor_1104" href="#Footnote_1104" class="fnanchor">1104</a>. About
the same time also the clock at Montargis was made, with the
following <span class="locked">inscription:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Charles le Quint (sc. de France)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Me fit par Jean de <i>Jouvence</i>.</span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">The last word seems to be the name of a Frenchman.</p>

<p>Though I have not happened to meet with any mention of
very early clocks in Germany, yet from the great clock at
Paris in 1370 being the work of De Wic, as also from the
protection granted by Edward III. to three clock-makers from
Delft, it should seem that this part of <span class="locked">Europe<a name="FNanchor_1105" id="FNanchor_1105" href="#Footnote_1105" class="fnanchor">1105</a></span> was not without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
this useful invention; and the same may be inferred with regard
to Spain from the old saying, “Estar como un <span class="locked">relox<a name="FNanchor_1106" id="FNanchor_1106" href="#Footnote_1106" class="fnanchor">1106</a></span>.”</p>

<p>Having now produced instances of several clocks, and even
a watch, which were made in different parts of the fourteenth
century, as also having endeavoured to prove that they were
not excessively uncommon even in the thirteenth, it may be
thought necessary that I should account for their not being
more generally used during those periods, as in their present
state at least they are so very convenient. For this it should
seem that many reasons may be assigned.</p>

<p>In the infancy of this new piece of mechanism, they were
probably of a very imperfect construction, perhaps never went
tolerably, and were soon deranged, whilst there was no one
within a reasonable distance to put them in order. To this
day the most musical people have seldom a harpsichord in
their house, if the tuner cannot be procured from the neighbourhood.
We find therefore that Henry VI. of England,
and Charles V. of France, appointed clock-makers, with a stipend,
to keep the Westminster and Paris clocks in order.</p>

<p>It need scarcely be observed also, that, as the artists were
so few, their work must have been charged accordingly, and
that kings only could be the purchasers of what was rather an
expensive toy than of any considerable use. And it may
perhaps be said, that they continued in a great measure to be
no better than toys till the middle of the seventeenth century.
Add to this, that in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries,
there was so little commerce, intercourse, or society, that an
hour-glass, or the sun, was very sufficient for the common
purposes, which are now more accurately settled by clocks of
modern construction. Dials and hour-glasses likewise wanted
no mending.</p>

<p>Having now finished what hath occurred to me with regard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
to the first introduction of clocks, I shall conclude by a few
particulars, which I have been enabled to pick up, in relation
to those more portable measurers of time, called <i>watches</i>, the
earliest of which, except that of Robert Bruce, king of Scotland,
seems to be one in Sir Ashton Lever’s most valuable
museum, the date upon which is <span class="locked">1541<a name="FNanchor_1107" id="FNanchor_1107" href="#Footnote_1107" class="fnanchor">1107</a></span>.</p>

<p>Derham, in his Artificial <span class="locked">Clock-maker<a name="FNanchor_1108" id="FNanchor_1108" href="#Footnote_1108" class="fnanchor">1108</a></span>, published in 1714,
mentions a watch of Henry VIII. which was still in order; and
Dr. Demainbray informs me, that he hath heard both Sir Isaac
Newton and Demoivre speak of this <span class="locked">watch<a name="FNanchor_1109" id="FNanchor_1109" href="#Footnote_1109" class="fnanchor">1109</a></span>. The emperor
Charles V., Henry’s contemporary, was so much pleased with
these time-measurers, that he used to sit after his dinner with
several of them on the table, his bottle being in the <span class="locked">centre<a name="FNanchor_1110" id="FNanchor_1110" href="#Footnote_1110" class="fnanchor">1110</a></span>;
and when he retired to the monastery of St. Just, he continued
still to amuse himself with keeping them in order, which is
said to have produced a reflection from him on the absurdity
of his attempt to regulate the motions of the different powers
of Europe.</p>

<p>Some of the watches used at this time seem to have been
strikers; at least we find in the Memoirs of Literature, that
such watches having been stolen both from Charles V. and
Lewis XI. whilst they were in a crowd, the thief was detected
by their striking the <span class="locked">hour<a name="FNanchor_1111" id="FNanchor_1111" href="#Footnote_1111" class="fnanchor">1111</a></span>. In most of the more ancient
watches, of which I have seen several in the collection
of Sir Ashton Lever and Mr. Ingham Forster, catgut supplied
the place of a <span class="locked">chain<a name="FNanchor_1112" id="FNanchor_1112" href="#Footnote_1112" class="fnanchor">1112</a></span>, whilst they were commonly of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
smaller size than we use at present, and often of an oval
<span class="locked">form<a name="FNanchor_1113" id="FNanchor_1113" href="#Footnote_1113" class="fnanchor">1113</a></span>.</p>

<p>From these and probably many other imperfections, they
were not in any degree of general request till the latter end
of queen Elizabeth’s reign. Accordingly in Shakspeare’s
Twelfth Night, Malvolio says, “I frown the while, and perchance
<i>wind up my watch</i>, or play with some rich jewel.”
Again, in the first edition of Harrington’s Orlando Furioso,
printed in 1591, the author is represented with what seems to
be a watch, though the engraving is by no means distinct, on
which is written “Il tempo <span class="locked">passa<a name="FNanchor_1114" id="FNanchor_1114" href="#Footnote_1114" class="fnanchor">1114</a></span>.”</p>

<p>In the third year of James I., a watch was found upon Guy
Fawkes, which he and Percy had bought the day before, “to
try conclusions for the long and short burning of the touch-wood,
with which he had prepared to give fire to the train of
<span class="locked">powder<a name="FNanchor_1115" id="FNanchor_1115" href="#Footnote_1115" class="fnanchor">1115</a></span>.”</p>

<p>In 1631, Charles I. incorporated the clock-makers; and the
charter prohibits <i>clocks</i>, <i>watches</i>, and <i>alarms</i>, from being imported;
which sufficiently proves that they were now more
commonly used, as well as that we had artists of our own who
were expert in this branch of business.</p>

<p>About the middle of the seventeenth century, Huygens made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
his great improvement in clock-work, which produced many
others from our own <span class="locked">countrymen<a name="FNanchor_1116" id="FNanchor_1116" href="#Footnote_1116" class="fnanchor">1116</a></span>; the latest of which was
the introduction of repeating watches, in the time of Charles
II., who, as I have been informed by the late lord Bathurst,
sent one of the first of these new inventions to Lewis XIV.
The former of these kings was very curious with regard to these
time-measurers; and I have been told by an old person of the
trade, that watchmakers, particularly East, used to attend whilst
he was playing at the Mall; a watch being often the stake.</p>

<p>But we have a much more curious anecdote of royal attention
to watches in Dr. Derham’s Artificial Clock-maker
(p. 107). Barlow had procured a patent, in concert with the
Lord Chief Justice Allebone, for <i>repeaters</i>; but Quare making
one at the same time upon ideas he had entertained before the
patent was granted, James II. tried both, and giving the preference
to Quare’s, it was notified in the gazette. In the succeeding
reign, the reputation of the English work in this branch
was such, that in the year 1698, an act passed, obliging the
makers to put their names on watches, lest discreditable ones
might be sold abroad for <span class="locked">English<a name="FNanchor_1117" id="FNanchor_1117" href="#Footnote_1117" class="fnanchor">1117</a></span>.</p>

<h3><i>Letter on the pretended Watch of King Robert Bruce</i><a name="FNanchor_1118" id="FNanchor_1118" href="#Footnote_1118" class="fnanchor smaller">1118</a>.</h3>

<p>You will remember that I formerly mentioned something to
you in reference to the observations made by the Hon. Daines
Barrington, on the earliest introduction of clocks, published
in the Annual Register for 1779, under the article Antiquities,
p. 133. According to your desire, I will communicate what
circumstances come within my personal knowledge, about a
watch that corresponds very much to one described by him
as once the property of king Robert Bruce. I must be indulged,
although in some particulars I cannot speak with absolute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
certainty, as so much time hath elapsed since the transaction
I am going to relate.</p>

<p>Being early fond of anything ancient or uncommon, I used
to purchase pieces of old coin from a goldsmith who wrought
privately in Glasgow, and sometimes went about as a hawker.
Having often asked him from the curiosity of a boy, if he
had ever been at the castle of Clackmannan, or heard of any
antiquities being found there, he told me that he had purchased
from Mrs. Bruce, who is the only survivor of that
ancient family in the direct line, an old watch, which was found
in the castle, and had an inscription, bearing, that it belonged
to king Robert Bruce. I immediately asked a sight of it; but
he told me it was not at hand. He fixed a time for showing
me this invaluable curiosity; but even then it could not be
seen. My avidity produced many anxious calls, although by
that time I began to suspect he meant to play upon me, especially
as I did not think it altogether credible that Mrs. Bruce
would sell such a relict of her family if she had ever had it
in her possession. At length I was favoured with a sight of it.
The watch, as far as I can recollect, almost entirely answered
the one described. It had a ground of blue enamel. It had
a horn above the dial-plate instead of a glass. The inscription
was on the plate. But whether it was <i>Robertus B.</i> or <i>Robertus
Bruce</i>, I cannot remember. The watch was very small and
neat, and ran only, to the best of my knowledge, little more than
twelve hours, at least not a complete day. The Hon. Mr.
Barrington does not mention anything about this circumstance.
It is about twelve years since I saw it. Whether there be any
castle in Fife properly called Bruce castle, I know not; but
the castle of Clackmannan hath always been the residence of
the eldest branch of the family; and although the town in
which it stands now gives name to a small county, yet in former
times, and still in common language, that whole district receives
the name of Fife, as distinguishing it from the county
on the other side of the firths of Forth and Tay. The first
thing that occurred to me about the watch itself, was in regard
to the inscription. Observing that all the coins of king Robert’s
age bore Saxon characters, I could not believe the inscription
to be genuine, because the characters were not properly
Saxon, but a kind of rugged Roman, or rather Italic
characters, like those commonly engraved, but evidently done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
very coarsely, to favour the imposition. He valued it at 1<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i>,
but I would have nothing to do with it. The first time I had
an opportunity of seeing Mrs. Bruce of Clackmannan, after
this, I asked her if such a watch had ever been found. She
told me that she never so much as heard of any such thing.
This confirmed the justness of my suspicion.</p>

<p>I paid no further regard to this story till about seven years
ago, when I received a letter from a friend, informing me, that
a brother of his in London, who had a taste for antiquity, had
desired him, if possible, to procure some intelligence from
Glasgow about a watch, said to be king Robert Bruce’s, which
had thence found its way to London, and was there making
a great noise among the antiquaries. I then applied to my
former goldsmith, who was then in a more respectable way,
and mentioned the old story. He immediately fell a-laughing,
and told me, that he did it merely for a piece of diversion,
and thought the story would take with me, as I had been often
asking about the place. He said that it was an old watch
brought from America; that, to get some sport with my credulity,
he had engraved the inscription upon it in a rough,
antiquated-like form; that he had afterwards sold it for two
guineas; he had learned that it was next sold for five, and had
never more heard of it.</p>

<p>However early the invention of clocks might be, I am
greatly mistaken if any authentic documents can be produced
of the art of making pocket-watches being discovered so early
as the beginning of the fourteenth century. Lord Kaimes,
somewhere in his Sketches of Man, asserts, that the first watch
was made in Germany, so far as I can remember, near the close
of the fifteenth <span class="locked">century<a name="FNanchor_1119" id="FNanchor_1119" href="#Footnote_1119" class="fnanchor">1119</a></span>. If any watch had been made so
early as R. Bruce’s time, it is most likely the inscription would
have been in Saxon characters, as not only the money both of
Scotland and England, but of Germany, in that age, bears a
character either Saxon, or greatly resembling it.</p>

<p>Whatever ardour one feels for anything that bears the genuine
marks of antiquity, it is certainly a debt he owes to those
who have the same taste, to contribute anything in his power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
that may prevent impositions, to which antiquaries are abundantly
subject, through the low humour or avarice of others;
or that may tend to confirm a fact by proper comparison and
minute investigation of circumstances. Besides, this is of
greater moment than settling the genuineness of a coin, or
many other things of the same nature, because it involves in
it the date of a very important discovery. It doth not merely
refer to the history of an individual, or even of one nation,
but to the history of man. It respects the progress of the arts;
and an anachronism here is of considerable importance,
because, being established upon a supposed fact, it becomes a
precedent for writers in future ages.</p>

<p>[The time and place at which watches were first made similar
to those now in use, are not positively determined. The
first step towards its accomplishment must have consisted in
making a mainspring the source of motion instead of a
<span class="locked">weight<a name="FNanchor_1120" id="FNanchor_1120" href="#Footnote_1120" class="fnanchor">1120</a></span>. The invention of the fusee speedily followed the
mainspring, and without it the former would be useless, in
consequence of its tension varying according to the size of its
coil. In the time of Elizabeth a watch was a very different
kind of instrument to one of the present day. As regards size, it
closely resembled one of our common dessert-plates. Before Dr.
Hooke’s improvement, the performance of watches was so very
irregular that they were considered as serving only to give the
time for a few hours, and this in rather a random kind of way.
The invention by Dr. Hooke of a spiral spring applied to the
arbor of the balance, by which means effects were produced
on its vibrations similar to the action of gravity on the pendulum
of a clock, was perhaps of more importance than any
improvement which has been subsequently made. Watches
were common in France before 1544, as in that year the
corporation of master clockmakers in Paris had a statute enacted
to ensure to themselves the exclusive privilege of making
and causing to be made clocks and watches, large or small,
within the precincts of that city. The anchor-escapement was
invented by Clement, a London clockmaker, in 1680. Previously
to 1790, two kinds of watches were made, the vertical
and the horizontal. The former was first used in clocks, then
in watches. The horizontal was invented in 1724, by George<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
Graham, F.R.S. (an apprentice of the renowned Tompion), to
whom we are indebted for two of the most valuable improvements
in clocks which have ever been made, viz. the dead-beat,
or Graham <span class="locked">escapement<a name="FNanchor_1121" id="FNanchor_1121" href="#Footnote_1121" class="fnanchor">1121</a></span>, as it is called, and the mercurial compensation
pendulum. The best proof that can be adduced of
the importance of these inventions is, that they still continue
to be employed in all their early simplicity, in the construction
of the best astronomical clocks of the present day. Graham’s
horizontal escapement is still extensively employed in the Swiss
and Geneva watches, but in the better sort of those of English
manufacture, it has been superseded by the duplex, and recently
by the lever, which is nothing more than the application
of Graham’s dead-beat escapement to the watch, though
patents have been taken out by various persons who have
claimed the invention. The most remarkable inventions of
this period were those of Harrison, consisting of his gridiron
pendulum, the going fusee, the compensation curb, and the
remontoir escapement. In 1736, he appears to have completed
his longitude watch, and received from the Royal Society their
gold medal; he ultimately received the government reward of
£20,000, together with other sums from the Board of Longitude
and the Honourable East India Company. Notwithstanding his
application of the compensation curb to the watch, it was still
a subject of inquiry, and by many persons it was thought that
the expansion and contraction of the metal, of which the spring
is composed, was the source of variation in the equality of its
motion under changes of temperature; but the consideration
that the change of rate in the clock, with a seconds pendulum, in
passing from the winter to the summer temperature, amounted
only to about twenty seconds, while that of the watch exceeded
six minutes and a half under similar circumstances, led careful
observers to infer that some other cause must be assigned for
the anomaly, and the loss of elasticity of the balance-spring
by heat began to be suspected, as appears by the following
passage in the Prize Essay of Daniel Bernoulli, read before
the French Academy:&mdash;“I must not omit (said this celebrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
geometrician) a circumstance which may be prejudicial to balance
watches; it is, that experimental philosophers pretend to
have remarked that certain changes of elastic force uniformly
follow changes of temperature. If that be the case, the spring
can never uniformly govern the balance.” That which Bernoulli
only conjectured, was in 1773 established as a matter
of certainty, and the amount in loss of time due to each of the
three conjointly operating causes determined by Berthoud to
be,&mdash;loss by expansion of the balance, 62 seconds; loss by
elongation of the balance-spring, 19 seconds; and loss by the
diminution of the spring’s elastic force by heat, 312 seconds, by
an increase of 60° of heat of Fahrenheit’s scale. We have
previously observed that Harrison’s compensation curb was inefficient,
as besides other defects, it interfered too much with the
isochronism of the balance-spring, as the inventor himself was
candid enough to confess that the balance, balance-spring,
and compensation curb, were not contemporaneously affected
by changes of temperature, since small pieces of metal were
sooner affected than large, and those in motion before those at
rest. Whence he was led to conclude, that if the provision for
heat and cold could properly reside in the balance itself, as
was the case with his gridiron pendulum clocks, the time-piece
might be made much more perfect. This ingenuous observation
is the more to Harrison’s credit, as it was certainly his interest
to conceal such a suggestion, being at that time a candidate
for the government reward. The complexity of Harrison’s
timekeeper and the high price, £400, demanded by
Kendall to make them after that model, still left the timekeeper
to be discovered that would come within the means of purchase
of private individuals: for admirably as Harrison had
succeeded in the construction of those which had procured
him his reward, and great as were the talents of his assistant
Larcum Kendall, yet for practical purposes, there needed an
instrument of greater simplicity, and to John Arnold we are
indebted for its invention.</p>

<p>Arnold is also celebrated for the manufacture of the smallest
repeating-watch ever known: it was made for his majesty
George III., to whom it was presented on his birthday, the
4th of June 1764. Although less than six-tenths of an inch in
diameter, it was perfect in all its parts, repeated the hours,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
quarters and half-quarters, and contained the first ruby cylinder
ever made. Indeed so novel was the construction of
this little specimen of mechanical skill, that he was forced not
only to form the design and execute the work himself, but also
to manufacture the greater part of the tools employed in its construction.
It is minutely described in Rees’s Cyclopædia, and
also in the Sporting Magazine of that time, in which latter
work it is correctly stated to be of the size of a silver twopence,
and its weight that of a sixpence. The King was so
much pleased with this rare specimen of mechanical skill, that
he presented Mr. Arnold with 500 guineas; and the Emperor
of Russia afterwards offered Mr. Arnold 1000 guineas for a
duplicate of it, which he declined.</p>

<p>Arnold’s model, though destined to perform the same office
as Harrison’s, was entirely different in its construction, and
was as simple as his predecessor’s was complex. By progressive
stages of improvement, it was brought by the inventor
himself to so high a point of perfection, that it continues to be
the model followed in the construction of the best chronometers
of the present day. The instruments upon which Arnold
experimented are now in the possession of his successor,
Mr. C. Frodsham, and show the gradual progress of advancement
made in the escapement, &amp;c., until he arrived at that
beautiful, yet simple, detached escapement, which is still followed,
and known under the name of the Arnold escapement.
He was the first watchmaker who introduced jewelling into
watches and clocks, and in 1771 he applied ruby pallets to the
two clocks of the Royal Society by Graham and Smeaton, and
likewise to the transit clock by Graham at the Royal Observatory,
Greenwich. In 1776 Arnold achieved what was unquestionably
his greatest work, viz. the invention of the cylindrical
spring and compensation balance, and their application
in the chronometer, which is the name that Arnold then
first employed to designate his timekeepers. This ingenious
and valuable discovery introduced a new æra in chronometry.
Each part of the machine under the new arrangement performed
unchecked the office assigned to it. The escapement
was completely detached, except at the moment of discharge
and giving impulse; the balance-spring, no longer interfered
with in corrections for temperature (as formerly) by the compensating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
curb, became a free agent and the generator of motion,
in which state only it is capable of being perfectly isochronized;
the balance, by its expansion and contraction,
varied its inertia according to the varied tension of the balance-spring
by its increased or diminished elastic force in changes
of temperature, while the office of the main-spring was reduced
to that of a simple maintaining power. This beautiful discovery,
together with the law of isochronism and other important
improvements in the modification of the compensation
balance, procured for him and his son John Roger Arnold the
reward from government of the sum of £3000. The accuracy
with which <i>chronometers</i> keep time is truly astonishing:
in 1830 two chronometers constructed by Mr. Charles Frodsham
were submitted for public trial at the Royal Observatory,
Greenwich, for twelve months, and were observed daily.
One of them made an extreme variation of 86-hundredth
parts of a second, and the other of 57-hundredths only; but
even this degree of accuracy, surprising as it is, is surpassed
by the performance of his best <i>astronomical</i> clocks. It is
therefore highly honourable to the English artists, that by their
ingenuity and skill they have accomplished the great object
which had occupied the attention of the learned of Europe
for nearly 300 years, namely, the means of discovering the
longitude at sea. It is not a little singular that Sir Isaac
Newton suggested the discovery of the longitude by the aid of
an accurate timekeeper.</p>

<p>If we go back to the period of Philip III. of Spain, we shall
then see the interest and importance attached to this great
discovery. As early as 1598, this monarch offered a reward
of 100,000 crowns to any person who should discover the
means of finding the longitude of a ship at sea; but what
was the opinion then entertained of the nature of the task to
be accomplished by means of the balance-watches then in use,
may be gathered from an expression of Morin, who wrote
about the year 1630, and who in speaking to the Cardinal
Richelieu of the difficulty of constructing an instrument which
should keep time to the requisite degree of accuracy for that
purpose, is reported to have said, “Id verò an ipsi dæmoni
nescio, homini autem suscipere scio esse <span class="locked">stultissimum<a name="FNanchor_1122" id="FNanchor_1122" href="#Footnote_1122" class="fnanchor">1122</a></span>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
We have not said much on the beautiful discovery of the
law of isochronism, of the balance-spring, on which the higher
adjustment of clocks and watches so entirely depend, as an
elaborate essay on this subject by Charles Frodsham, F.R.A.S.,
is in the hands of the publisher, and will shortly be circulated.</p>

<p>Some very ingenious contrivances have within the last few
years been effected in the application of the electric fluid as
a source of motive power to clocks and chronometers, and
they offer peculiar advantages in the great simplicity of the
apparatus in which wheels are dispensed with, hence friction
is reduced to a minimum. Their invention is a subject of
dispute between Professor Wheatstone and Mr. Alexander
<span class="locked">Bain<a name="FNanchor_1123" id="FNanchor_1123" href="#Footnote_1123" class="fnanchor">1123</a></span>. We shall briefly describe Mr. Bain’s clock. His
source of electricity is obtained by fixing galvanic plates in moist
earth. The clock consists of a pendulum, the bob of which
vibrates between the poles of two permanent magnets, the
opposite poles of which face one another. A small platinum-ball
is affixed to the upper part of a small brass stem, which is
free for lateral motion, being fastened below to a light spindle
carried by the upper part of the pendulum-rod. A wire coated
with silk is attached to the lower end of the suspension-spring
of the pendulum. It is led down the back of the rod (which
is composed of wood) and then coiled longitudinally in many
convolutions around the edge of the bob in a groove. It is
then taken up the back of the rod and terminates in the
bearings of the spindle. The pendulum is suspended from a
metal bracket fixed to the back of the case, and to which one
of the poles of the battery is attached. Two pins are fixed
horizontally, parallel with the platinum-ball, leaving space for
its lateral motions, and at such a distance that the ball alternately
comes into contact with each pin, when the pendulum
has reached the opposite extremity of its arc. The other pole
of the battery is placed in contact with the metal bracket which
supports one of the pins. As long as the platinum-ball rests
on the pin projecting from the pin-bracket to which the second
pole of the battery is attached, a constant current of electricity
is established and passes through the earth, the plates and the
wires. But when the pendulum is set in motion by being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
drawn on one side, the point of support of the rod carrying
the platinum-ball is thus moved to the same side, hence the
centre of gravity of the platinum-ball being removed beyond
its base, it falls upon the opposite pin. This motion of the
ball lets on and cuts off the flow of electricity, at or near the
ends of the vibrations of the pendulum, so that the convoluted
wire of the bob is alternately attracted and repelled by the
magnets at the proper points of its vibrations, and thus a continual
motion is kept up. Mr. Bain has also contrived arrangements
by which a great number of clocks may be worked
simultaneously or in rotation; as also by which ordinary clocks
may be made to keep time. The latter are effected by transmitting
a current of electricity once in every four hours from
a regulating clock. As the details connected with these valuable
contrivances can hardly be followed without figures, we
must rest satisfied with referring the reader to Mr. Bain’s
work, before cited.]</p>

with catgut, but now has a chain. It goes extremely well, but requires
winding-up every twenty-six hours to keep it accurately to time. Queen
Mary bequeathed it to Mary Seton, February 7, 1587. An engraving with

<h2 id="quarantine">QUARANTINE.</h2>

<p>Of all the means by which in modern times the infection of
that dangerous malady, the plague, has been so much guarded
against, that according to general opinion, unless the Deity
render all precaution useless, it can never again become common
in Europe, the most excellent and the most effectual is,
without doubt, the establishment of <span class="locked">quarantine<a name="FNanchor_1124" id="FNanchor_1124" href="#Footnote_1124" class="fnanchor">1124</a></span>. Had not
history been more employed in transmitting to posterity the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
crimes of princes, and particularly the greatest of them, destructive
wars, than in recording the introduction of such institutions
as contribute to the convenience, peace, health and happiness
of mankind, the origin of this beneficial regulation would
be less obscure than it is at present. At any rate, I have never
yet been so fortunate as to obtain a satisfactory account of it;
but though I am well-aware that I am neither acquainted with
all the sources from which it is to be drawn, nor have examined
all those which are known to me, I will venture to lay
before my readers what information I have been able to collect
on the subject, assuring them at the same time, that it will
afford me great pleasure if my attempt should induce others
fond of historical research to enlarge it.</p>

<p>The opinion that the plague was brought to Europe from
the East, is, as far as I am able to judge, so fully confirmed,
that it cannot be any longer doubted; though it is certainly
true, that every nation endeavours to trace the origin of infectious
disorders to other people. The Turks think that the
plague came to them from Egypt; the inhabitants of that country
imagine that they received it from Ethiopia; and perhaps the
Ethiopians do not believe that this dreadful scourge originated
among <span class="locked">them<a name="FNanchor_1125" id="FNanchor_1125" href="#Footnote_1125" class="fnanchor">1125</a></span>. As the plague however has always been conveyed
to us from the East, and has first, and most frequently,
broken out in those parts of Europe which approach nearest
to the Levant, both in their physical and political situation,
those I mean which border on Turkey, and carry on with it
the most extensive trade, we may with the more probability
conjecture that these countries first established quarantine,
the most powerful means of preventing that evil. If further
search be made in regard to this idea, we shall be inclined to
ascribe that service to the Venetians, a people who, when the
plague began to be less common, not only carried on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
greatest trade in the Levant, but had the misfortune to become
always nearer neighbours to the victorious Turks. It is also
probable that the Hungarians and Transylvanians soon followed
their example in this approved precaution, as the Turks
continued to approach them; and this agrees perfectly with
everything I have read in history.</p>

<p>In the first centuries of the Christian æra, it does not seem
to have been known that infection could be communicated by
clothing and other things used by infected persons. The Christians
all considered the plague as a divine punishment, or predestinated
event, which it was as impossible to avoid as an
earthquake; and the physicians ascribed the spreading of it to
corrupted air, which could not be purified by human art. The
Christians therefore gave themselves up, like the Turks at
present, to an inactive and obstinate resignation in the will of
God, and hoped by fasting and prayer to hasten the end of
their misfortune.</p>

<p>But after the plague in the fourteenth century, which continued
longer than any other, and extended over the greater
part of Europe, the survivors found that it was possible to
guard against or prevent infection; and governments then
began to order establishments of all kinds to be formed against
it. The oldest of which mention has yet been found in history,
are those in Lombardy and Milan of the years 1374, 1383
and <span class="locked">1399<a name="FNanchor_1126" id="FNanchor_1126" href="#Footnote_1126" class="fnanchor">1126</a></span>.</p>

<p>In the first-mentioned year the Visconte Bernabo made
regulations, the object of which was to guard against the
spreading of the plague by intercourse and mixing with those
who were infected; and with that view it was ordered, that
those afflicted with this disease should be removed from the
city, and allowed either to die or to recover in the open air.
Those who acted otherwise were to suffer capital punishment,
and their property was to be confiscated. But twenty-five
years after it was strictly commanded that the clothes and
things used by those who had the plague should be purified
with great care: and in 1383 it was forbidden under severe
punishment to suffer any infected person to enter the country.
These means, however imperfect, must have been attended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
with utility, because they were again employed during a new
danger of the same kind in the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>Brownrigg, an Englishman, who wrote a book on the means
of preventing the plague, says, that quarantine was first established
by the Venetians in the year <span class="locked">1484<a name="FNanchor_1127" id="FNanchor_1127" href="#Footnote_1127" class="fnanchor">1127</a></span>, but like his
learned countryman Mead, who assigns the same year, without
adducing any <span class="locked">proofs<a name="FNanchor_1128" id="FNanchor_1128" href="#Footnote_1128" class="fnanchor">1128</a></span>. I imagined that I should find some
more certain information respecting this point in Le Bret’s
History of the Republic of Venice; but as that historian does
not mention, as the title professes, the original sources from
which he derived his materials, his work is less worthy of
credit. He tells us however that the grand council in 1348,
chose three prudent persons, whom they ordered to investigate
the best means for preserving health, and to lay the result of
their inquiry before the council. The plague which broke
out afterwards in 1478, rendered it necessary that some permanent
means should be thought of, and on that account a
peculiar magistracy consisting of three noblemen, with the
title of <i>sopra la sanità</i>, was instituted in 1485. As these were
not able to stop the progress of the disease, the painful office
was imposed upon them, in 1504, of imprisoning people against
whom complaints might be lodged, and even of putting them
to death; and in 1585 it was declared, that from the sentence
of these judges there should be no appeal. Their principal
business was to inspect the lazarettos erected in certain
places at some distance from the city, and in which it was required
that all persons and merchandize coming from suspected
parts should continue a stated time fixed by the laws. The
captain of every ship was obliged also to show there the bill
of health which he had brought along with him.</p>

<p>As Le Bret produces no proof that quarantine was established
by the Venetians so early as he says, I cannot help
suspecting that he is mistaken respecting the year (1348), and
conjecture that it ought to be 1448, or perhaps 1484. I
have not been able however to resolve my doubt; for, in examining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
different Italian writers, I find that various years are
<span class="locked">given<a name="FNanchor_1129" id="FNanchor_1129" href="#Footnote_1129" class="fnanchor">1129</a></span>. The institution of the council of health (<i>sopra la
sanità</i>) is mentioned by Bembo; but I cannot discover from
him to what year he <span class="locked">alludes<a name="FNanchor_1130" id="FNanchor_1130" href="#Footnote_1130" class="fnanchor">1130</a></span>. His countryman Lancellotti,
who undoubtedly must have understood him well, makes it to
be <span class="locked">1491<a name="FNanchor_1131" id="FNanchor_1131" href="#Footnote_1131" class="fnanchor">1131</a></span>. Caspar Contarenus, who died in 1542, in the
sixtieth year of his age, mentions no particular period, and
only says that the institution had been formed not long before
his <span class="locked">time<a name="FNanchor_1132" id="FNanchor_1132" href="#Footnote_1132" class="fnanchor">1132</a></span>. The islands on which the pest-houses were erected,
were called <i>il Lazaretto vecchio</i> and <i>il Lazaretto nuovo</i>. In
the elegant description of Venice, ornamented with abundance
of plates, below mentioned, it is remarked that the pest-house
on the former island was built in 1423, and that on the latter
in <span class="locked">1468<a name="FNanchor_1133" id="FNanchor_1133" href="#Footnote_1133" class="fnanchor">1133</a></span>. The same account is given in the newest and best
Topography of <span class="locked">Venice<a name="FNanchor_1134" id="FNanchor_1134" href="#Footnote_1134" class="fnanchor">1134</a></span>.</p>

<p>The Venetians are entitled to the merit of having improved
the establishments formed to prevent infection; and that
their example was followed in other countries is generally
admitted. But the year in which quarantine was first ordered
by them to be performed is uncertain. <span class="locked">Muratori<a name="FNanchor_1135" id="FNanchor_1135" href="#Footnote_1135" class="fnanchor">1135</a></span>, following
Lorenzo Candio, gives the year 1484, and <span class="locked">Howard<a name="FNanchor_1136" id="FNanchor_1136" href="#Footnote_1136" class="fnanchor">1136</a></span> says that
the college of health was instituted in 1448.</p>

<p>Brownrigg affirms that letters of health, in which he confides
more than in quarantine, were first written in 1665 by the
consuls of the different commercial nations, but they are much
older, for <span class="locked">Zegata<a name="FNanchor_1137" id="FNanchor_1137" href="#Footnote_1137" class="fnanchor">1137</a></span> asserts that they were first established in
1527, when the plague again made its appearance in Europe.</p>

<p>This much is certain, that all these means against infection,
which, though far from being perfect, have secured Europe
from this misfortune, were not invented or proposed by physicians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
but ordered by the police, contrary to their theory. The
latter seem to have known, at an early period, the most dangerous
causes of infection, and to have formed at a very great
expense precautionary means, the observance of which was
enforced under pain of the severest punishment.</p>

<p>Why the space of forty days was chosen as a proof I do not
know. It arose no doubt from the doctrine of the physicians
in regard to the critical days of many diseases. The fortieth
day seems to have been considered as the last or extreme of
all the critical days; on which subject many physicians appear
to have entertained various astrological <span class="locked">conceits<a name="FNanchor_1138" id="FNanchor_1138" href="#Footnote_1138" class="fnanchor">1138</a></span>. On the
Turkish frontiers this period was reduced under the emperor
Joseph II. to twenty <span class="locked">days<a name="FNanchor_1139" id="FNanchor_1139" href="#Footnote_1139" class="fnanchor">1139</a></span>.</p>

<p>[With respect to the quarantine establishments in this country,
M<sup>c</sup> Culloch observes that they are exceedingly defective.
Even in the Thames there is not a lazaretto where
a ship from a suspected place may discharge her cargo and
refit; so that she is detained, frequently at an enormous expense,
during the whole period of quarantine, while if she have
perishable goods on board, they may be very materially injured.
The complaints as to the oppressiveness of quarantine
regulations are almost wholly occasioned by the want of proper
facilities for its performance. Were these afforded, the burdens
it imposes would be rendered comparatively light.</p>

<p>The existing quarantine regulations are embodied in the
act 6 George IV. c. 78, and the different orders in council
issued under its authority. These orders specify what vessels
are liable to perform quarantine, the places at which it is to
be performed, and the various formalities and regulations to
be complied with.]</p>

<h2 id="paper">PAPER-HANGINGS.</h2>

<p>Three kinds of paper-hangings have for some time past been
much used on account of their beautiful appearance and their
moderate price. The first and plainest is that which has on
it figures printed or drawn either with one or more colours.
The second sort contains figures covered with some woolly
stuff pasted over them; and the third, instead of woolly stuff, is
ornamented with a substance that has the glittering brightness
of gold and silver. It appears that the idea of covering walls
with parti-coloured paper might have readily occurred, but
the fear of such hangings being liable to speedy decay may
have prevented the experiment from being made. In my
opinion the simplest kind was invented after the more ingenious,
that is to say, when the woolly or velvet kind was already
in <span class="locked">use<a name="FNanchor_1140" id="FNanchor_1140" href="#Footnote_1140" class="fnanchor">1140</a></span>. The preparation of them has a great affinity to the
printing of cotton. Wooden blocks of the like kind are employed
for both; plates of copper are also used; and sometimes
they are painted after patterns. Artists possess the talent of
giving them such a resemblance to striped and flowered silks
and cottons, that one is apt to be deceived by them on the
first view. Among the most elegant hangings of this kind,
may be reckoned those which imitate so exactly every variety
of marble, porphyry, and other species of stones, that when the
walls of an apartment are neatly covered with them, the best
connoisseur may not without close examination be able to
discover the deception. That the resemblance may be still
greater, a hall may be divided by an architect into different
compartments by pillars, so as to have the appearance of a
grand piece of regular architecture. Whether M. Breitkopf
at Leipsic was the inventor of this kind of hangings, I do not
know, but it is certain that he brought it to great perfection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
The second kind, or, as it is called, velvet-paper (now called
flock-paper), is first printed like the former, but the figures are
afterwards wholly, or in part, covered with a kind of glue,
over which is strewed some woolly substance, reduced almost
to dust, so that by these means they acquire the appearance
of velvet or plush. The ground and the rest of the figures
are left plain; but the whole process is so complex that it is
impossible to convey a proper idea of it by a short description.
The shearings of fine white cloth, which the artist procures
from a cloth manufactory, and dyes to suit his work, are employed
for this purpose. If they are not fine enough, he renders
them more delicate by making them pass through a close
hair-sieve. This, as well as the third kind, was formerly made
much more than at present upon canvas; and, in my opinion,
the earliest attempts towards this art were tried, not upon paper,
but on linen cloth. The paper procured at first for these experiments
was probably too weak; and it was not till a later
period that means were found out to strengthen and stiffen it
by size and paste.</p>

<p>The invention of velvet-paper is by several French <span class="locked">writers<a name="FNanchor_1141" id="FNanchor_1141" href="#Footnote_1141" class="fnanchor">1141</a></span>
ascribed to the English; and, if they are not mistaken, it was
first made known in the reign of Charles I. On the 1st of
May 1634, an artist, named Jerome Lanyer, received a patent
for this art, in which it is said that he had found out a method
of affixing wool, silk and other materials of various colours
upon linen cloth, silk, cotton, leather and different substances
with oil, size and cements, so that they could be employed for
hangings as well as for other <span class="locked">purposes<a name="FNanchor_1142" id="FNanchor_1142" href="#Footnote_1142" class="fnanchor">1142</a></span>. The inventor wished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
to give to this new article the name of Londrindiana, which
appears however not to have continued in use. It is worthy
of remark, that this artist first made attempts to affix silk upon
some ground, but that method as far as I know was not brought
to perfection; that he employed for the ground, linen and cotton
cloth, or leather; and that no mention is made of his
having used paper, though he seems not to have confined himself
entirely to leather or cloth.</p>

<p>Tierce, a Frenchman, has however disputed this invention
with the English; for he asserts that one of his countrymen at
Rouen, named François, made such kinds of printed paper-hangings
so early as the year 1620 and 1630, and supports
his assertion by the patterns and wooden blocks which are
still preserved, with the above-mentioned years inscribed on
<span class="locked">them<a name="FNanchor_1143" id="FNanchor_1143" href="#Footnote_1143" class="fnanchor">1143</a></span>. He is also of opinion, that some Frenchmen, who
fled to England when persecuted for their religion, carried
this art along with them. The inventor’s son followed this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>
business to a great extent for more than fifty years at Rouen,
and died in 1748. Some of his workmen went privately to
the Netherlands and Germany, where they sold their art; and
the French, therefore, with great confidence maintain, without
knowing our artists and their works, that foreigners in this
branch of manufacture are still far behind them. In most
works of the kind my countrymen indeed are only imitators,
not through want of talents to invent or to improve, but because
our great people, for whom they must labour, consider
nothing as fashionable or beautiful, except what has been first
made by the French or the English.</p>

<p>I shall here observe, that Nemeitz ascribes the invention of
wax-cloth-hangings, with wool chopped and beat very fine
(these are his own words), to a Frenchman named Audran,
who in the beginning of the last century was an excellent
painter in arabesque and grotesque figures, and inspector of
the palace of Luxemburg at Paris, in which he had a manufactory
for hangings of that <span class="locked">kind<a name="FNanchor_1144" id="FNanchor_1144" href="#Footnote_1144" class="fnanchor">1144</a></span>. What particular service
he rendered to the art of making paper-hangings, I have not
however been able to learn. Equally uncertain and defective
is the information of Von <span class="locked">Heinecken<a name="FNanchor_1145" id="FNanchor_1145" href="#Footnote_1145" class="fnanchor">1145</a></span>, that one Eccard invented
the art of imprinting on paper-hangings gold and silver
figures, and carried on a manufactory for such works.</p>

<p>In regard to the time when these hangings began to be
made in Germany, I can only say that the oldest information
I know respecting them is to be found in a <span class="locked">work<a name="FNanchor_1146" id="FNanchor_1146" href="#Footnote_1146" class="fnanchor">1146</a></span> by Andrew
Glorez von Mahren, printed for the first time in 1670. It
shows that the art was then very imperfect as well as little
known, and that it was practised only by women upon linen
for making various small <span class="locked">articles<a name="FNanchor_1147" id="FNanchor_1147" href="#Footnote_1147" class="fnanchor">1147</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span>
One of the most ingenious new improvements in the art of
manufacturing these hangings, consists in bestrewing them
here and there with a glittering metallic dust or sand, by
which they acquire a resemblance to rich gold and silver brocade.
From the above-quoted work it appears that artists
began very early to cover some parts of paper-hangings with
silver-dross or gold-foil; but as real gold was too dear to be
used for that purpose, and as imitations of it soon decayed,
this method seems not to have been long continued. Instead
of these, Nuremberg metallic dust as well as silver-coloured
foil are employed. Metallic dust is the invention of an artist
at Nuremberg, named John Hautsch, who constructed also a
carriage which could be moved by the person who sat in it.
He was born in the year 1595, and died in 1670. His descendants
have continued to the present time the preparation
of the metallic dust, which is exported in large quantities from
Nuremberg, and is used in shell-work, lackered-ware, and for
various other purposes. It is prepared by sifting the filings of
different metals, washing them in a strong lye, and then placing
them on a plate of iron or copper over a strong fire, where
they are continually stirred till their colour is altered. Those
of tin acquire by this process every shade of gold-colour, with
a metallic lustre; those of copper the different shades of red
and flame-colour; those of iron and steel become of a blue or
violet; and those of tin and bismuth appear of a white or
bluish-white colour. The dust, tinged in this manner, is afterwards
put through a flatting-mill, which consists of two rollers
of the hardest steel, like those used by gold and silver wire-drawers,
but for the greater convenience a funnel is placed
over <span class="locked">them<a name="FNanchor_1148" id="FNanchor_1148" href="#Footnote_1148" class="fnanchor">1148</a></span>. I have in my possession samples of all the above
kinds, which have an exceedingly beautiful appearance. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
metallic dust is affixed so strongly to paper by means of a
cement, that it is almost impossible to detach it without tearing
the paper, as is the case with the paper-hangings procured from
Aachen. In French, such paper is called <i>papier avec paillettes</i>.
The lustre of it is so durable that it continues unaltered even
on the walls of sitting-apartments. The metallic dust however
has a considerable weight, which may undoubtedly injure
the paper.</p>

<p>This inconvenience may have induced artists to employ,
instead of metallic dust, that silver-coloured mica, which has
been long used in the like manner. So early as the seventeenth
century the miners at Reichenstein in Silesia collected
and sold for that purpose various kinds of mica, even the
black, which acquires a gold-colour by being exposed to a
strong <span class="locked">heat<a name="FNanchor_1149" id="FNanchor_1149" href="#Footnote_1149" class="fnanchor">1149</a></span>. The nuns of Reichenstein ornamented with it
the images which they made, as the nuns in France and other
catholic countries ornamented their <i>agni Dei</i>, by strewing
over them a shining kind of <span class="locked">talc<a name="FNanchor_1150" id="FNanchor_1150" href="#Footnote_1150" class="fnanchor">1150</a></span>. The silver-coloured mica
however has not such a bright metallic lustre as metallic dust,
but it nevertheless has a pleasing effect when strewed upon a
white painted ground, and its light thin spangles or scales retain
their brightness and adhere to the paper as long as it
lasts. At present I am acquainted with no printed information
respecting the method of laying on metallic dust and mica,
nor do I know where artists procure the latter, which in many
countries is indeed not scarce. I shall here observe, that I
once saw at Petersburg a kind of Chinese paper, which appeared
all over to have a silver-coloured lustre without being
covered with any metallic substance, and which was exceedingly
soft and pliable. It bore a great resemblance to paper
which has been rubbed over with dry acid of borax. I conjecture
that its surface was covered with a soft kind of talc,
pounded extremely fine; but as I have none of it in my possession
at present, I can give no further account of it.</p>

<p>[The manufacture of this important and elegant substitute
for the ancient “hangings” of tapestry has undergone a gradual
succession of improvements, and has now reached a
high state of beauty and perfection. The patterns on these
papers are sometimes produced by stencil plates, but more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
commonly by blocks, each colour being laid on by a separate
block cut in wood or metal upon a plain or tinted ground.
The patterns are sometimes printed in varnish or size, and gilt
or copper-leaf applied; or bisulphuret of tin is dusted over
so as to adhere to the pattern; and in what are called <i>flock-papers</i>,
dyed wools mixed into powder are similarly applied.
Powdered steatite or French chalk is used to produce the
peculiar gloss known under the name of <i>satin</i>. Striped papers
are sometimes made by passing the paper rapidly under a
trough, which has parallel slits in its bottom through which
the colour is delivered; and a number of other very ingenious
and beautiful contrivances have lately been applied in this
important branch of art. The invention of the paper-machine,
by which any length of paper may be obtained, effected a great
change in paper-hangings, which could formerly only be printed
upon separate sheets, and were much more inconvenient to
print as well as to apply to the <span class="locked">walls<a name="FNanchor_1151" id="FNanchor_1151" href="#Footnote_1151" class="fnanchor">1151</a></span>.]</p>

<p class="fn4"><a name="Footnote_1142" id="Footnote_1142" href="#FNanchor_1142" class="fnanchor">1142</a>  I shall here insert the words of the patent: “To all those to whom
these presents shall come, greeting. Whereas our trusty and well-beloved
subject and servant Jerome Lanyard hath informed us, that he by
his endeavours hath found out an art and mystery by affixing of wool, silk
and other materials of divers colours upon linen cloth, silk, cotton, leather
and other substances, with oil, size and other cements, to make them useful
and serviceable for hangings and other occasions, which he calleth Londrindiana,
and that the said art is of his own invention, not formerly used by
any other within this realm, &amp;c.”&mdash;Rymeri Fœdera, tom. xix. London,
1732, fol. p. 554. The following observations may serve to illustrate all
works of this nature in general. Painting, according to the most common
technical meaning, may be divided into three kinds. In the first the colours
or pigments are mixed with a viscous or glutinous fluid to bind them, and
make them adhere to the body which is to be painted. Gums, glue, varnish,
&amp;c. may be used for this purpose. Vegetable colours will not admit
of such additions, because they contain gum in their natural composition.
Another kind consists in previously washing over the parts that are to
be painted with some viscous substance, and then laying on the colours
as the figures may require. Size or cement (I use the word in the most
extensive sense) is of such a nature that either in drying or glazing it becomes
hard, and binds the colours. To this method belongs not only
gilding, imitating bronze and making velvet-paper-hangings, but also painting
on glass and in enamel. By the third method the colours are applied
to the ground without any binding substance: they are therefore more
liable to decay, as is the case in painting with crayons; but they will however
adhere better when the pigments consist of very fine particles like
ceruse, or black-lead. It would be a great acquisition if a substance could
be found out to bind the colours used in this art without injuring them, or
to fix the crayons. The third kind of painting is not with colours, but
with different bodies ready coloured, which are joined together in pieces
according to a copy, either by cement or plaster, as in mosaic, or by working
them into each other, as in weaving and sewing, which is painting with
the needle.... Are not the works of art almost like those of nature,
each connected together as a chain? Do not the boundaries of one art
approach those of another? Do they not even touch each other? Those
who do not perceive this approximation are like people unacquainted with
botany, who cannot remark the natural order of plants. But if a connoisseur
observe a gap in the chain of artificial works, we are to suppose that
some links are still wanting, the discovery of which may become a merit
to more ingenious ages.</p></div>

<h2 id="kermes">KERMES. COCHINEAL.</h2>

<p>Though a variety of information respecting the history of
cochineal and kermes may be found scattered in the works of
different authors, I shall venture to lay before the public what
I have gathered on the subject; as I flatter myself with the
hope of being able to rectify some errors of my predecessors,
as well as to supply deficiencies which they have left; and as
it will undoubtedly be agreeable to many readers to see collected
in one point of view whatever is most important, with
the addition of a few explanatory observations and notes.</p>

<p>Cochineal and kermes, as they appear in commerce, are
small grains, shaped almost like those small dried grapes
without stones, which are called currants. They are sometimes
of a deep and sometimes of a fainter reddish-brown, or
violet-brown colour, are often covered with a gray dust or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
<span class="locked">mouldiness<a name="FNanchor_1152" id="FNanchor_1152" href="#Footnote_1152" class="fnanchor">1152</a></span>, appear full of wrinkles, as succulent bodies generally
do when dried, and for the most part are a little more
raised on the one side than on the other. When these grains
are chewed, they have a somewhat bitterish and astringent
taste, and communicate to the spittle a brownish-red colour.
They are employed in medicine, but their principal use is in
dyeing.</p>

<p>It is now well-known that they belong to that genus of insects
called <i>Coccus</i>, and that they are principally the dried
impregnated females. Numerous species of these insects have
been described by <span class="locked">entomologists<a name="FNanchor_1153" id="FNanchor_1153" href="#Footnote_1153" class="fnanchor">1153</a></span>, who have most frequently
named them from the plants on which they occur; for the
present object, however, it will be sufficient to take notice
only of three kinds.</p>

<p>The first is the real American cochineal, or that which at
present is most used, but which at the same time is the dearest.
By Linnæus it is called <i>Coccus Cacti</i>. The second kind is
found chiefly on a species of oak, the <i>Quercus Ilex</i>, in the
Levant, Spain, France, and other southern countries, and is
therefore called <i>Coccus Ilicis</i>, <i>Coccus arborum</i>, and often also
kermes. The third comprehends that saleable cochineal found
on the roots of several perennial plants, which is known commonly
under the appellation of Polish or German cochineal;
though it is not certain whether those insects produced upon
the perennial knawel (<i>Scleranthus</i>), bears-breech (<i>Uva-ursi</i>)
and other plants, be the same species. They are often distinguished
also by the name of <i>Coccus radicum</i>.</p>

<p>That the second species has been mentioned by the ancient
Hebrew, Greek, Latin and Arabian writers cannot be denied;
and those who know that our information respecting the nature
of this commodity, which is perhaps even yet imperfect,
has been in modern times procured after much labour and research,
will not be surprised to find their accounts mingled
with many falsehoods and contradictions. The ancients must
have been under more doubt and in greater ignorance on this
subject, the less they were acquainted with the propagation of
these insects; but we should be too precipitate were we to
reject entirely everything they have said that may deviate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
from the truth; and I think it would be no difficult task to
produce writers of the seventeenth and of the eighteenth century,
whose information on this point is as dubious and incorrect
as that to be found in the writings of the ancients.</p>

<p>All the ancient <span class="locked">Greek<a name="FNanchor_1154" id="FNanchor_1154" href="#Footnote_1154" class="fnanchor">1154</a></span> and Latin writers agree that kermes,
called by the latter <i>coccum</i>, perhaps also <i>coccus</i>, and often
<i>granum</i>, were found upon a low shrubby tree, with prickly
leaves, which produced acorns, and belonged to the genus of
the oak; and there is no reason to doubt that they mean <i>Coccus
Ilicis</i>, and that low evergreen oak, with the prickly leaves
of the holly (<i>aquifolium</i>), which is called at present in botany
<i>Quercus Ilex</i><a name="FNanchor_1155" id="FNanchor_1155" href="#Footnote_1155" class="fnanchor">1155</a>. This assertion appears more entitled to credit,
as the ancients assign for the native country of this tree places
where it is still indigenous and produces kermes.</p>

<p>According to the account of Dioscorides, kermes were collected
in Galatia, Armenia, Asia, Cilicia and Spain. Most
commentators suppose that there must be here some error, as
that author first mentions Galatia and Armenia, and then Asia
in general. Some, therefore, understand by the latter, the city
of Asia in Lydia; others have altered or rejected the word
altogether; and Serapion, in his Arabic translation, seems to
have read Syria. Professor Tychsen, however, assured me
that <i>Asia proconsularis</i> is here meant, to which Cilicia did not
belong; and in this particular sense the word is often used by
writers contemporary with Dioscorides. Of this difficulty
Salmasius takes no notice.</p>

<p>We are informed by <span class="locked">Pliny<a name="FNanchor_1156" id="FNanchor_1156" href="#Footnote_1156" class="fnanchor">1156</a></span> that kermes were procured from
Asia and Africa; from Attica, Galatia, Cilicia, and also from
Lusitania and Sardinia; but those produced in the last-mentioned
place were of the least value. Pausanias says that they
were to be found in Phocis. As the <i>coccus</i> is mentioned likewise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
by Moses and other Hebrew writers, kermes must have
been met with at that period in some of the remote countries
of the <span class="locked">East<a name="FNanchor_1157" id="FNanchor_1157" href="#Footnote_1157" class="fnanchor">1157</a></span>. Bochart has quoted passages from the manuscript
works of Arabian authors, which undoubtedly allude
also to kermes; and I shall class among these, without any
hesitation, the account of Ctesias, which has been copied by
Photius, Ælian, and the poet Phile, though in more than one
circumstance it deviates from the truth. It has already been
considered by Tyson and Delaval as alluding to kermes, or
rather the American cochineal, which Tyson, however, seems
to confound with the genus of insects <i>Coccinella</i>, in English
called the <span class="locked">lady-bird<a name="FNanchor_1158" id="FNanchor_1158" href="#Footnote_1158" class="fnanchor">1158</a></span>.</p>

<p>That the kermes-oak still grows and produces <span class="locked">kermes<a name="FNanchor_1159" id="FNanchor_1159" href="#Footnote_1159" class="fnanchor">1159</a></span> in
the Levant, Greece, Palestine, Persia and India, is sufficiently
proved by the testimony of modern travellers. Bellon and
Tournefort saw kermes collected in the island of Crete or
<span class="locked">Candia<a name="FNanchor_1160" id="FNanchor_1160" href="#Footnote_1160" class="fnanchor">1160</a></span>; the former saw them also between Jerusalem and
<span class="locked">Damascus<a name="FNanchor_1161" id="FNanchor_1161" href="#Footnote_1161" class="fnanchor">1161</a></span>; and he informs us that the greater part of them
was sent to Venice. That they are indigenous in Persia, is
expressly affirmed by Chardin. The kermes of Spain are so
well known that it is not necessary to bring proofs of their
being a production of that country. Dioscorides says that
the Spanish kermes were <span class="locked">bad<a name="FNanchor_1162" id="FNanchor_1162" href="#Footnote_1162" class="fnanchor">1162</a></span>; and we are expressly told by
Garidel, that they are still of less value than the French.</p>

<p>With the real nature of kermes the ancients were not acquainted.
By the greater part they were considered as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>
proper fruit of the tree; and although they remarked the insects,
it was a common opinion that they were produced from
putrefaction without propagation; and on this account they
did not perceive their real origin. They imagined that the
insects were the effects of corruption; and Pliny speaks as if
he conceived that certain species were liable to this fault
more than others. They were therefore named <i>scolecion</i>, and
less valued. But in another passage he calls kermes, not improperly,
a scurf or scab of the tree, <i>scabies fruticis</i>. Dioscorides
says that the kermes appeared on the tree like lentils, a
comparison with which Matthiolus is highly displeased; but
it cannot be altogether unnatural, as many of the moderns,
who never read the writings of the Greeks, compare them also
to lentils or peas. The account, that a kind of kermes in Sicily,
like small snails, was collected by the women with their
mouths, seems to be attended with more difficulty. The comparison
of snails, which may not be altogether inconsistent, I
shall admit; but the gathering with the mouth is too much
contrary to common sense not to be disputed. Commentators,
therefore, have proposed various emendations, which
seem to be drawn from the different readings; but the common
one alluded to must be very old, as it has been adopted
by Serapion in his <span class="locked">translation<a name="FNanchor_1163" id="FNanchor_1163" href="#Footnote_1163" class="fnanchor">1163</a></span>. Marcellus and Cornarius
are of opinion that a word must be inserted, expressive of the
time when the kermes were gathered; and that instead of
“with the mouth,” ought to be read “in <span class="locked">summer<a name="FNanchor_1164" id="FNanchor_1164" href="#Footnote_1164" class="fnanchor">1164</a></span>.” For my
part, I think a word signifying some instrument employed by
the women in collecting them would be more proper; for the
Grecian women, according to Bellon’s account, use still for
that purpose a small instrument shaped like a sickle. In

Galen ascribe to kermes an astringent, bitter taste; but I shall
leave to the examination of physicians the medicinal qualities
for which they have extolled them. I shall remark only, as a
technologist, that kermes was used formerly in dyeing purple
to give what is called the ground; but our dyers employ it to
communicate a scarlet colour, which, without doubt, excels the
purple of the ancients.</p>

<p>The first-mentioned use of kermes in dyeing seems to have
been continued through every century. In the middle ages,
as they are called, we meet with kermes under the name of
<i>vermiculus</i> or <i>vermiculum</i>; and on that account cloth dyed
with them was called <i>vermiculata</i>. Hence the French word
<i>vermeil</i>, and its derivative <i>vermilion</i>, as is well-known, had
their extraction; the latter of which originally signified the
red dye of kermes, but it is now used for any red paint, and
also for finely pounded cinnabar. In France and Spain, at present,
kermes, as soon as they are gathered, are besprinkled
with vinegar and dried in the sun; but it appears that in the
middle ages they were not dried sufficiently, and that they
were put into leather bottles to prevent them from making
their <span class="locked">escape<a name="FNanchor_1167" id="FNanchor_1167" href="#Footnote_1167" class="fnanchor">1167</a></span>. In preparing the liquid dye, dyers used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
Egyptian alum, the only kind then to be had, and also <span class="locked">urine<a name="FNanchor_1168" id="FNanchor_1168" href="#Footnote_1168" class="fnanchor">1168</a></span>.
This dye seems to have been known in Germany so early as
the twelfth century; for among the productions of the country
which Henry the Lion sent as a present to the Greek emperor
we find <i>scarlata</i><a name="FNanchor_1169" id="FNanchor_1169" href="#Footnote_1169" class="fnanchor">1169</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
Our ancestors, in all probability, procured their kermes
from the southern part of France, or rather from Spain. The
Arabians, who from the earliest periods had been acquainted
with this production in Africa, found it in Spain, and employed
it there for dyeing, and as an article of commerce;
and on this account, as appears, the Arabic name <i>kermes</i>, or
<i>alkermes</i>, became so <span class="locked">common<a name="FNanchor_1170" id="FNanchor_1170" href="#Footnote_1170" class="fnanchor">1170</a></span>. Salmasius thinks that the Arabs
borrowed this word from the Latins, and that it is formed
from <i>vermes</i><a name="FNanchor_1171" id="FNanchor_1171" href="#Footnote_1171" class="fnanchor">1171</a>; but even if we allow that it is not an original
Arabic word, it is perhaps more probable that it is of Celtic
extraction, as is the opinion of <span class="locked">Astruc<a name="FNanchor_1172" id="FNanchor_1172" href="#Footnote_1172" class="fnanchor">1172</a></span>. <i>Guer</i> or <i>quer</i> signified
in the Celtic language a green (evergreen) oak; and in
Lower Languedoc, uncultivated land on which the kermes-oak
grows is still called <i>garrigues</i>. From this <i>guer</i> or <i>quer</i> Astruc
is inclined to derive also the Latin word <i>quercus</i>, the etymology
of which is nowhere else to be found. This conjecture
is of the more importance, as <i>mes</i> in some parts signifies the
fruit of the oak; so that <i>guermes</i> or kermes would be the
acorns, <i>les glands du chesne</i>. Although kermes are not acorns,
we cannot reject this appellation as improbable. Having requested
the opinion of Professor Tychsen, as being well-acquainted
with the Arabic language, on this subject, he readily
complied with my desire, and I have given it in the note below,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
in his own <span class="locked">words<a name="FNanchor_1173" id="FNanchor_1173" href="#Footnote_1173" class="fnanchor">1173</a></span>. It deserves to be remarked, that <i>carmesin</i>,
<i>carmin</i>, <i>cramoisi</i> of the French, and <i>charmesi</i>, <i>chermesino</i> of
the Italians, and other like words, hence derive their origin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
The coccus found on the roots of some plants, as far as I know,
has not been mentioned by the ancients. That these insects
however were collected in Germany in the twelfth century, was
first proved, as I think, by J. L. <span class="locked">Frisch<a name="FNanchor_1174" id="FNanchor_1174" href="#Footnote_1174" class="fnanchor">1174</a></span>. We are told that in
this, and at least in the following century, several monasteries
caused their vassals to collect this <i>coccus</i>, and bring to them by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
way of <span class="locked">tribute<a name="FNanchor_1175" id="FNanchor_1175" href="#Footnote_1175" class="fnanchor">1175</a></span>, and that those who could not deliver the production
in kind were obliged to pay, in its stead, a certain sum
of money. The measure by which it was delivered was called
<i>coppus</i>, in German <i>Kopf</i>, which word signified formerly not
only a globular drinking-vessel, but also a measure both for
dry and liquid things. It is still retained in the latter sense
in Zurich, Aachen, Regensburg, Austria, and several other
<span class="locked">places<a name="FNanchor_1176" id="FNanchor_1176" href="#Footnote_1176" class="fnanchor">1176</a></span>. As the <i>coccus</i> was gathered at midsummer (St.
John’s day), it was called St. John’s blood; probably because
the clergy wished by that appellation to make this revenue
appear as a matter of religion; and that name is still continued
among the country people. As the monks and nuns
carried on at that time various trades, particularly that of
weaving, they could employ the St. John’s blood to very good
<span class="locked">purpose<a name="FNanchor_1177" id="FNanchor_1177" href="#Footnote_1177" class="fnanchor">1177</a></span>.</p>

<p>At later periods I find mention of the <i>coccus</i> only in the
works of naturalists, such as those of <span class="locked">Cornarius<a name="FNanchor_1178" id="FNanchor_1178" href="#Footnote_1178" class="fnanchor">1178</a></span>, <span class="locked">Scaliger<a name="FNanchor_1179" id="FNanchor_1179" href="#Footnote_1179" class="fnanchor">1179</a></span>,
and others; but how long the use of it, and the collecting of
it for religious houses, continued, I cannot determine; perhaps
longest in Poland. From that country, even at present (1792),
a considerable quantity of it is sent every year to Venice;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>
and I am inclined to believe that some of it is collected still
in the county of Mark, and other parts of Germany. The
following, as far as I can find, are the reasons why this indigenous
production has lost its value. First, the root-kermes
contain less colouring matter than the kermes of France and
Spain. Secondly, the collecting of the former is more laborious
as well as more tedious; and after they ceased to be
paid <i>in natura</i> to the monasteries, they became too dear to
stop the sale of those of France and Spain. But when the
American cochineal, which is undoubtedly a far superior pigment,
was in latter times made an article of commerce, and
was sent to Europe in large quantities for dyeing, as it could
be procured at all times, and in abundance, at a price which,
if not low, was at least moderate, considering its excellent
quality, from Mexico, where labour was <span class="locked">cheaper<a name="FNanchor_1180" id="FNanchor_1180" href="#Footnote_1180" class="fnanchor">1180</a></span>, and where
it was cultivated in plantations formed on purpose, the French
and Spanish kermes were entirely forgotten, as appears by a
French ordinance of 1671 respecting dye-stuffs: and this was
the case much more with the German, which, in all probability,
will never turn to great account, though some have entertained
a contrary opinion.</p>

<p>Mexico, or New Spain, the original country of the cochineal,
which word appears to be the diminutive of <i>coccus</i><a name="FNanchor_1181" id="FNanchor_1181" href="#Footnote_1181" class="fnanchor">1181</a>, was discovered
by the Spaniards in 1518 and the years following.
Who first remarked this profitable production, and made it
known in Europe, I have not been able to discover. Some assert
that the native Mexicans, before they had the misfortune of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>
being visited by the Christians, were acquainted with cochineal,
which they employed in painting their houses and dyeing their
<span class="locked">clothing<a name="FNanchor_1182" id="FNanchor_1182" href="#Footnote_1182" class="fnanchor">1182</a></span>; but others maintain the <span class="locked">contrary<a name="FNanchor_1183" id="FNanchor_1183" href="#Footnote_1183" class="fnanchor">1183</a></span>. The Spaniards,
who had long used kermes in their own country, could not
fail soon to observe the superiority of the American; and I
find by Herrera, that the king in the year 1523 desired to be
informed by Cortez, whether what he had been told was true,
that kermes were to be found in abundance in Mexico, and if
they could, as was supposed, be sent with advantage to Spain.
He requested him, should this information be true, to pay
attention to it, and to cause them to be collected with diligence.
This commodity must soon after have begun to be an object
of commerce; for Guicciardini, who died in 1589, mentions
cochineal among the articles procured then by the merchants
of Antwerp from <span class="locked">Spain<a name="FNanchor_1184" id="FNanchor_1184" href="#Footnote_1184" class="fnanchor">1184</a></span>. The plant on which the animal
lives, belongs to the genus <i>Cactus</i>, and in Mexico is called
<i>nopal</i> or <i>tuna</i>, though several plants of the same kind seem to
be comprehended under the latter name. One species is the
<i>Opuntia</i>, which has become indigenous in Spain, Portugal,
and Italy, and which is not scarce in our green-houses. A
second species is the <i>cochinillifera</i>. <span class="locked">Oviedo<a name="FNanchor_1185" id="FNanchor_1185" href="#Footnote_1185" class="fnanchor">1185</a></span> described and
gave figures of two kinds of <i>tuna</i>; but of the cochineal he makes
no mention. He speaks however of an excellent dye which
the Americans prepared from the fruit, and formed into small
cakes; but he afterwards acknowledges that he had received
no authentic account on this subject. I nevertheless suspect
that these cakes were made of cochineal; for Hernandez says
that such were made in his time.</p>

<p>With the first cochineal, a true account of the manner in
which it was procured must have reached Europe, and become
publicly known. Acosta in 1530, and Herrera in 1601, as
well as Hernandez and others, gave so true and complete a description
of it, that the Europeans could entertain no doubt
respecting its origin. The information of these authors, however,
was either overlooked or considered as false, and disputes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>
arose whether cochineal was insects or worms, or the berries
or seeds of certain plants. The Spanish name <i>grana</i>, confounded
with <i>granum</i>, may have given rise to this contest;
but there is not, perhaps, in all natural history a point which
can be so fully cleared up as this can by the most undoubted
testimony. A Dutchman, named Melchior de Ruusscher, affirmed
in a society, from oral information he had obtained in
Spain, that cochineal consisted of small animals. Another
person, whose name he has not made known, maintained the
contrary with so much heat and violence, that the dispute at
length ended in a bet. Ruusscher charged a Spaniard, one of
his friends, who was going to Mexico, to procure for him in
that country authentic proofs of what he had asserted. These
proofs, legally confirmed in October 1725, by the court of
justice in the city of Antiquera, in the valley of Oaxaca, arrived
at Amsterdam in the autumn of the year 1726. I have
been informed that Ruusscher upon this got possession of the
sum betted, which amounted to the whole property of the
loser; but that, after keeping it a certain time, he again returned
it, deducting only the expenses he had been at in procuring
the evidence, and in causing it to be published. It
formed a small octavo volume, with the following title, printed
in red letters: The History of Cochineal, proved by authentic
<span class="locked">documents<a name="FNanchor_1186" id="FNanchor_1186" href="#Footnote_1186" class="fnanchor">1186</a></span>. These proofs sent from New Spain are written
in Dutch, French, and Spanish.</p>

<p>It may be readily supposed, that the high esteem in which
this production was held would soon induce people to endeavour
to convey these insects to other countries in order to
breed them. This the Spaniards did every thing in their
power to prevent; and notwithstanding the severity of the
means which they employed, attempts were made for that
purpose. When Rolander, a scholar of Linnæus, was in
America, he sent to Upsal, at the request of that celebrated
naturalist, a plant, with the insects upon it. The plant arrived
in the year 1756, when Linnæus was engaged with his pupils.
The gardener, who was not acquainted with the nature of it,
cleared it from what he thought vermin, and planted it; so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>
Linnæus, when he returned from his class, did not find a single
insect alive. This circumstance, which he has mentioned in
his Systema Naturæ, I was told by himself. I am however of
opinion, that this was not the real cochineal, but the other kind
spoken of by Sylvester; as the former, according to the latest
information, can scarcely be procured even with more labour
and expense than Rolander could bestow, and would hardly
stand such a long voyage to the northern regions. The spurious
kind were sent from Jamaica to England, on the <i>Opuntia
ficus Indica</i>, which was planted by <span class="locked">Miller<a name="FNanchor_1187" id="FNanchor_1187" href="#Footnote_1187" class="fnanchor">1187</a></span>, but the insects
did not live above three or four months. Thiery, a young
French naturalist, brought the real cochineal to St. Domingo
in the year 1777, at so much hazard that he deserves a place
in the martyrology of the naturalist; but after his death, which
soon followed, the insects perished through the avarice or negligence
of his successors; and in that island there are none
now to be found but the spurious <span class="locked">kind<a name="FNanchor_1188" id="FNanchor_1188" href="#Footnote_1188" class="fnanchor">1188</a></span>.</p>

<p>I am inclined to believe that the art of employing kermes
to dye a beautiful red colour was discovered in the East at a
very early period; that it was soon so much improved as to
excel even the Tyrian purple; and that it contributed to cause
the proper purple to be at length abandoned. From the costly
red dyes extolled so much by the Hebrew writers, and which,
according to the opinion of learned commentators, were made
from kermes, I shall not venture to adduce any proofs, as I am
not acquainted with the Oriental languages to examine their
accounts with accuracy; but I have found a passage in <span class="locked">Vopiscus<a name="FNanchor_1189" id="FNanchor_1189" href="#Footnote_1189" class="fnanchor">1189</a></span>,
which seems to render my conjecture very probable.
That author informs us, that the king of Persia sent to the
emperor Aurelian, besides other articles of great value, some
woollen cloth, which was of a much costlier and brighter
purple colour than any that had been ever seen in the Roman
empire, and in comparison of which all the other purple cloth
worn by the emperor and the ladies of the court appeared dull
and faded. In my opinion, this cloth, which was of a beautiful
purple red colour, was not dyed with the liquor of the murex,
but with kermes. This idea was indeed not likely to occur to
the Romans, who were acquainted only with the purple of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span>
murex, and who had less experience in the arts in general
than in that of robbing and plundering, or who at any rate in
that respect were inferior to the Orientals. The Roman emperors
caused this supposed purple to be sought for in India
by the most experienced dyers, who, not being able to find it,
returned with a vague report that the admired Persian purple
was produced by the plant <i>Sandix</i>. I am well aware, that
some commentators have supposed that the <i>Sandix</i> was our
<span class="locked">madder<a name="FNanchor_1190" id="FNanchor_1190" href="#Footnote_1190" class="fnanchor">1190</a></span>. Hesychius, however, says, very confidently, that
the <i>sandix</i> is not a plant, but a kind of shrubby tree which
yields a dye like the <i>coccus</i><a name="FNanchor_1191" id="FNanchor_1191" href="#Footnote_1191" class="fnanchor">1191</a>. The Roman dyers, perhaps,
prejudiced in favour of the murex, made that only the object
of their search; and their labour proving fruitless, they might
have heard something of kermes, or the kermes-oak, which
they did not fully understand. Our dyers, even at present,
believe many false accounts respecting the dye-stuffs which
they use daily.</p>

<p>In later times, when it was known that the beautiful Oriental
kermes-dye was not properly purple, it was no longer called
by that name, but was considered as a new dye, and acquired
a new appellation. Cloth dyed with it was called <i>scarlata</i>,
<i>squarlata</i>, <i>scarleta</i>, <i>scarlatina</i>, <i>scharlatica</i>. That these words
have an affinity to our scarlet, every one allows, but it may be
difficult to discover their origin. <span class="locked">Pezronius<a name="FNanchor_1192" id="FNanchor_1192" href="#Footnote_1192" class="fnanchor">1192</a></span> affirms that they
are of Celtic extraction, and have the same signification as
<i>Galaticus rubor</i>. Astruc, as I have already shown, derives
kermes from the same language, which, however, like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span>
Egyptian history, is often employed to explain what people
cannot otherwise explain, because so little is known of both
that much contradiction is not to be apprehended. Others
wish to make scarlet from the <i>quisquilium</i>, <i>cusculium</i>, or <i>scolecium</i>
of Pliny. To some the word appears to be composed of
the first half of kermes and lack, with the addition of only an S,
and every one is left at liberty to determine at pleasure, whether
lack is to be understood as the Arabic for red, or the German
word <i>lacken</i> cloth. In the first case it signifies the same as
<i>vermiculare rubrum</i>; in the latter <i>pannus vermicularis</i>. <span class="locked">Stiler<a name="FNanchor_1193" id="FNanchor_1193" href="#Footnote_1193" class="fnanchor">1193</a></span>
says <i>scarlach</i> is entirely German, and compounded of <i>schor</i>
the fire, and <i>lacken</i> cloth, so that its real signification is fire-cloth,
fire-coloured cloth. Reiske, on the other hand, asserts,
that the word is originally the Arabic <i>scharal</i>, which means
the <span class="locked">kermes-dye<a name="FNanchor_1194" id="FNanchor_1194" href="#Footnote_1194" class="fnanchor">1194</a></span>. Which of these conjectures is most agreeable
to truth, cannot with certainty be concluded; but that the
word is older than Dillon affirms it to be, on the authority of
a Spaniard, can be proved. Dillon says that it was first used
by Roderick, archbishop of Toledo, who finished his history
of Spain in <span class="locked">1243<a name="FNanchor_1195" id="FNanchor_1195" href="#Footnote_1195" class="fnanchor">1195</a></span>. <span class="locked">Vossius<a name="FNanchor_1196" id="FNanchor_1196" href="#Footnote_1196" class="fnanchor">1196</a></span> has quoted several writers who
use <i>escarletum</i> or <i>scarletum</i>. The oldest is Cæsarius, who
lived about the year 1227. Matthew Paris, who wrote about the
year 1245, used the word in referring to the year 1134. But I
find that the emperor Henry III. in the middle of the eleventh
century, conferred upon the count of Cleves the burg-graviate
of Nimeguen, on condition of his delivering to him yearly three
pieces of scarlet cloth made of English <span class="locked">wool<a name="FNanchor_1197" id="FNanchor_1197" href="#Footnote_1197" class="fnanchor">1197</a></span>. The word may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>
be often found in the twelfth century. It occurs in Petrus
<span class="locked">Mauritius<a name="FNanchor_1198" id="FNanchor_1198" href="#Footnote_1198" class="fnanchor">1198</a></span>, who died in 1157, and also in the writings of Arnold,
who, in 1175, was the first abbot of Lubeck.</p>

<p>Of the preparation and goodness of the ancient scarlet we
certainly know nothing: but as we find in many old pieces of
tapestry of the eleventh century, and perhaps earlier, a red
which has continued remarkably beautiful even to the present
time, it cannot at any rate be denied that our ancestors extolled
their scarlet not without reason. We may however
venture to assert, that the scarlet prepared at present is far
superior, owing principally to the effects of a solution of tin.
This invention may be reckoned among the most important
improvements of the art of dyeing, and deserves a particular
relation.</p>

<p>The tincture of cochineal alone yields a purple colour, not
very pleasant, which may be heightened to the most beautiful
scarlet by a solution of tin in aqua regia, or muriatic <span class="locked">acid<a name="FNanchor_1199" id="FNanchor_1199" href="#Footnote_1199" class="fnanchor">1199</a></span>.
M. Ruhlenkamp at Bremen, one of the most learned dyers of
Germany, and who has studied with great care every new improvement
of his art, gave me the history of this scarlet dye,
as I have already related in my Introduction to <span class="locked">Technology<a name="FNanchor_1200" id="FNanchor_1200" href="#Footnote_1200" class="fnanchor">1200</a></span>.
The well-known Cornelius Drebbel, who was born at Alkmaar,
and died at London in 1634, having placed in his window an
extract of cochineal, made with boiling water, for the purpose
of filling a thermometer, some aqua regia dropped into it from
a phial, broken by accident, which stood above it, and converted
the purple dye into a most beautiful dark red. After
some conjectures and experiments, he discovered that the tin
by which the window-frame was divided into squares had been
dissolved by the aqua-regia, and was the cause of this change.
He communicated his observation to Kuffelar, an ingenious
dyer at Leyden, who was afterwards his <span class="locked">son-in-law<a name="FNanchor_1201" id="FNanchor_1201" href="#Footnote_1201" class="fnanchor">1201</a></span>. The
latter brought the discovery to perfection, and employed
it some years alone in his dye-house, which gave rise to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>
name of <span class="locked">Kuffelar’s-colour<a name="FNanchor_1202" id="FNanchor_1202" href="#Footnote_1202" class="fnanchor">1202</a></span>. Becher calls him Kuffler. Kunkel,
in a passage which I cannot again find, makes his name Kuster,
and says that he was a German. In the course of a little time
the secret became known to an anabaptist called Gulich, and
also to another person of the name of Van der Vecht, who
taught it to the brothers Gobelins in France. Giles Gobelin, a
dyer at Paris, in the time of Francis I. had found out an improvement
of the then usual scarlet dye; and as he had remarked
that the water of the rivulet Bievre, in the suburbs of
St. Marceau, was excellent for his art, he erected on it a large
dye-house, which, out of ridicule, was called <i>Folie-Gobelins</i><a name="FNanchor_1203" id="FNanchor_1203" href="#Footnote_1203" class="fnanchor">1203</a>,
Gobelin’s-Folly. About this period, a Flemish painter, whom
some name Peter Koek, and others Kloek, and who had travelled
a long time in the East, established, and continued to
his death in 1550, a manufactory for dyeing scarlet cloth by
an improved <span class="locked">method<a name="FNanchor_1204" id="FNanchor_1204" href="#Footnote_1204" class="fnanchor">1204</a></span>. Through the means of Colbert, one
of the Gobelins learned the process used for preparing the
German scarlet dye from one Gluck, whom some consider as
the above-mentioned Gulich, and others as Kloek; and the
Parisian scarlet dye soon rose into so great repute, that the
populace imagined that Gobelin had acquired his art from the
<span class="locked">devil<a name="FNanchor_1205" id="FNanchor_1205" href="#Footnote_1205" class="fnanchor">1205</a></span>. It is well known that Louis XIV. by the advice of
Colbert, purchased Gobelin’s building from his successors in
the year 1667, and transformed it into a palace, to which he
gave the name of <i>Hôtel Royal des Gobelins</i>, and which he
assigned for the use of first-rate artists, particularly painters,
jewellers, weavers of tapestry, and others. After that time the
rivulet was no longer called Bievre, but Gobelins. About the
year 1643, a Fleming, named Kepler, established the first dye-house
for scarlet in England, at the village of Bow, not far from
London; and on that account the colour was called at first, by the
English, the <i>Bow-dye</i><a name="FNanchor_1206" id="FNanchor_1206" href="#Footnote_1206" class="fnanchor">1206</a>. In the year 1667, another Fleming, named
Brewer, invited to England by king Charles II. with the promise
of a large salary, brought this art there to great <span class="locked">perfection<a name="FNanchor_1207" id="FNanchor_1207" href="#Footnote_1207" class="fnanchor">1207</a></span>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>
All these accounts, however, and the names of the persons, are
extremely dubious.</p>

<p>[Mr. Ward states in his Mexico in 1827, vol. i. p. 84, that the
plantations of the Nopal (<i>Opuntia cochinillifera</i>), on which
the cochineal insects feed, are confined to the district La
Misteca in the state of Oaxaca, in Mexico. The animals are
domesticated and reared with the greatest care. When the
females have become fecundated and enlarged, the harvest
commences. The insects are brushed off with a squirrel’s tail,
and killed by immersing them in hot water, and afterwards
drying them in the sun, or by the heat of a stove. Three harvests
are made annually; the first being the best, since the
impregnated females alone are taken; in the second the young
females are also collected; and in the third both old and young
ones, and skins are collected indiscriminately. Before the
rainy season commences, branches of the nopal plant loaded
with young insects are cut off and preserved in the houses to
prevent the animals being destroyed by the weather. It is
stated in a letter from Mr. Faber to Dr. Pereira (Chemical Gazette
for January 15th, 1845), that the more extensive cultivators
never kill the insect by immersion, but only by the baskets
being placed in heated rooms or stoves.</p>

<p>Three kinds of cochineal are now met with in the English
market: the black, silver, and foxy. Silver cochineal is the impregnated
female insect, just before laying eggs; black cochineal
is the female after laying and hatching the eggs. That
technically known in London as “foxy” cochineal is composed
of the insects of silver cochineal which have been killed
by boiling water. They are thus burst, and acquire a peculiar
reddish colour, very different from the fine transparent red
which forms the finest black. It is said that on the average
one pound of cochineal contains 70,000 dried insects. The
quantity exported from and consumed in England in 1844,
amounted to no less than 1,569,120 lbs.!]</p>

will serve to illustrate what I have said above: “De vermiculo. In regno

nulla vestis linea colorem vermiculatum recipit, sed sola vestis quæ ex vivo

right, as animal substances take a dye more readily than vegetable.]
“Vermiculus autem ex arbore, ad modum ilicis et quantitatem
dumi pungitiva folia habente, prodit ad pedem, nodulum faciens mollem

century, or in the time of Charlemagne, and which contains a great many
receipts respecting dyeing and other arts. Among these is the receipt then
commonly used for dyeing red, <i>Compositio vermiculi</i>. It is much to be regretted
that the manuscript was so illegible that there are whole passages
entirely destitute of sense, and that many words occur of which no one has
given, or perhaps ever will be able to give, an explanation. We find, however,
that the kermes were boiled with urine in a linen bag (<i>in linteolo raro</i>):
<i>addis hurinam expumatam</i>. The other ingredients I confess I do not understand.
What is <i>luzarim</i>, <i>lulacim</i>, <i>quianus</i>, <i>coccaris</i>? Many of these
words seem to signify not simple but compounded pigments. Lulacim, by
p. 378, appears to have been the expressed juice of some plant boiled with
alum. “Coccarin nascitur in folio cedrin non tritæ.” Besides the word

tenuissimas.” See Fischer’s Geschichte des Teutschen Handels, Hanover,
1758, 8vo, i. p. 490. But can “munera juxta morem terræ nostræ” be
with propriety translated “the productions of the country?” With all
due respect to the extensive reading and great learning of Professor Fischer,
I must warn the reader against some errors which occur in his book, and
against his too bold assertions. From what he says, p. 448, one would
suppose that he compared the kermes to our acorns; but the fruit only of
the kermes-tree, as being a species of oak, has the figure of an acorn. In
p. 493, he ventures to criticise Professor J. H. Schulze, who, in Dissertat.
de Granorum Kermes Coccionellæ Convenientia, Viribus, et Usu, Halæ,
1743, adopts the opinion of a Dutchman (not an Englishman) De Ruuscher,
which has been completely justified, that cochineal is an insect. According
to Professor Fischer, both the insect and the acorn are cochineal.
He talks of plantations of the kermes-tree among the ancients, and seems
to believe that the Celts brought kermes along with them to Galatia, from
their original country, in the same manner as the Europeans carried with
them to America the corn of Europe. Kermes, however, are insects which
cannot be transplanted, and I do not find any proof that there were ever
plantations of them. [This assertion is far from correct. The true cochineal
insect has been introduced from Mexico into Java, Spain, and recently
into Algiers. The Journal de Pharmacie for Feb. 1844, contains a long
account, by M. Simounet, of the success of the cochineal plantations in
Algiers.] People collected kermes in the places where they happened to
find them. The comparison of cochineal with the lady-cow, or lady-bird,
as it is called, p. 493, is altogether improper, as that insect is the <i>Coccinella</i>,
which has no affinity to cochineal. His proposal to place the <i>Coccinellæ</i>,
or lady-birds, on the kermes-oak, or on the <i>Scleranthus</i> (perennial
knawell), is totally impracticable; and even were they to remain there
for eternity, they would never become cochineal or kermes.</p></div>

this idea upon the grounds that the Arabians themselves say everything of

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn4"><a name="Footnote_1173" id="Footnote_1173" href="#FNanchor_1173" class="fnanchor">1173</a>  “The word <i>kermes</i>, <i>karmes</i>, and, with the article, <i>al kermes</i>, is at present
in the East the common name of the animal which produces the dye,
as well as of the dye itself. Both words have by the Arabs and the commerce
of the Levant been introduced into the European languages. <i>Kermes</i>,
Span. <i>al charmes</i>, <i>al quermes</i>, or more properly <i>alkermes</i>, <i>alkarmes</i>.
Ital. <i>cremesino</i>, &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
“To what language the word originally belongs cannot with certainty be
determined. There are grounds for conjecturing several derivations from
the Arabic, for example, <i>karasa</i>, <i>extremis digitis tenuit</i>, which would not
ill-agree with <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">στόνυξ</span>; and <i>karmis</i> signifies <i>imbecillus</i>; but this word may
be derived from the small insect, as well as the insect from it. As all these
derivations, however, are attended with grammatical difficulties, and as the
Arabians, according to their own account, got the dye and the word from
Armenia, it appears rather to be a foreign appellation which they received
with the thing signified, when they overran Upper Asia. Jbn Beithar in
Bochart, Hierozoicon, ii. p. 625, calls kermes an Armenian dye; and the
Arabian lexicographers, from whom Giggeus and Castellus made extracts,
explain the kindred word <i>karmasal</i>, <i>coccineus</i>, <i>vermiculatus</i>, as an Armenian
word.
</p>
<p>
“This dye however was undoubtedly known to the Hebrews, the Phœnicians,
and the Egyptians, long before the epoch of the Arabians in the
East. Among the Hebrews the dye occurs, though not clearly, under other
names, <i>tola schani</i>, or simply <i>tola</i>, in their oldest writer, Moses. <i>Tola</i> is
properly the worm, and according to the analogy of <i>kermes</i>, worm-dye,
scarlet. The additional word <i>schani</i> signifies either double-dyed, or, according
to another derivation, bright, deep red dye. For both significations
sufficient grounds and old authorities might be quoted; but the
former is the most usual, and on account of its analogy with <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">δίβαφον</span>,
seems to be the most probable.
</p>
<p>
“But was the <i>coccus</i> known so early? Is not <i>tola</i>, the worm-dye, perhaps
the same with purple, because the ancients made no distinction between
<i>vermis</i> and snail? I believe not. For purple the Orientals have a
particular name, <i>argaman</i>, <i>argevan</i>, which is accurately distinguished from
<i>tola</i>, and is often added to it as something distinct. All the ancients therefore
translate the Hebrew word <i>tola</i> by <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">κόκκος</span>, kermes, <i>zehori</i> and <i>zehorito</i>
(deep red, bright dye), which words they never put for <i>argaman</i>. As the
Phœnicians traded at so early a period with Spain and other countries,
where the kermes are indigenous, it may be readily comprehended how
that dye was known in Palestine about and before the time of Moses.
</p>
<p>
“It must have been known also in Egypt about the same epoch; for when
Moses, in the wilderness, required scarlet to ornament the tabernacle, it could
have been procured only from that country. Whether kermes be indigenous
in Egypt, I do not know. On the word <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">καλάϊνον</span>, quoted by Bochart from
Hesychius as Egyptian, the abbreviation of which, <i>laia</i>, in the Ethiopic language
signifies scarlet, I lay no great stress, because it cannot be proved,&mdash;1st,
that the word is originally Egyptian, as it occurs several times in the
Greek writers and in various significations; and 2ndly, that it signifies
scarlet dye, because the ancients explain it sometimes by purple, sometimes
by sea-colour. See Bochart, l. c. p. 730. If the word be Egyptian,
it signifies rather red dye in general than defines purple colour. At any
rate, there is in Coptic for the latter a peculiar word, <i>scadschi</i>, or <i>sanhadschi</i>.
The latter is explained by Kircher in Prodrom. Copt. p. 337, ‘mercator
purpuræ, vermiculus coccineus, purpura,’ which is altogether vague
and contradictory. The Arabic lexicographer, whom he ought to have
translated, gives a meaning which expresses only <i>purple ware</i>.
</p>

<p>
“If one might venture a supposition respecting the language of a people
whose history is almost bare conjecture, I would ask if the Coptic <i>dholi</i>
was the name of scarlet in Egypt. The lexicographers explain it by a
worm, a moth; but in those passages of the translation of the Bible which
I have compared another word is always used, when allusion is made to
worms which gnaw or destroy. Was <i>dholi</i> the name of the worm that
yields a dye? As <i>dholi</i> sounds almost like the Hebræo-Phœnician <i>tola</i>, we
might farther conjecture that the Egyptians received both the name and
the thing signified from the Phœnicians. But this is mere opinion. The
following conclusions seem to be the natural result of the above observations:&mdash;
</p>

<blockquote class="hang">

<p>“1st. Scarlet, or the kermes-dye, was known in the East in the earliest
ages, before Moses, and was a discovery of the Phœnicians in Palestine,
but certainly not of the small wandering Hebrew tribes.
</p>
<p>
“2nd. <i>Tola</i> was the ancient Phœnician name used by the Hebrews, and
even by the Syrians; for it is employed by the Syrian translator, Isaiah,
chap. i. v. 18. Among the Jews, after their captivity, the Aramæan
word <i>zehori</i> was more common.
</p>
<p>
“3rd. This dye was known also to the Egyptians in the time of Moses;
for the Israelites must have carried it along with them from Egypt.
</p>
<p>
“4th. The Arabs received the name kermes, with the dye, from Armenia
and Persia, where it was indigenous, and had been long known; and
that name banished the old name in the East, as the name scarlet has
in the West. For the first part of this assertion we must believe the
Arabs.
</p>
<p>
“5th. Kermes were perhaps not known in Arabia; at least they were not
indigenous, as the Arabs appear to have had no name for them.
</p>
<p>
“6th. Kermes signifies always <i>red dye</i>; and when pronounced short, it
becomes <i>deep red</i>. I consider it, therefore, as a mere error of the translation
when, in Avicenna, iii. Fen. 21, 13, <i>kermesiah</i> is translated <i>purpureitas</i>.
It ought to be <i>coccineum</i>.”</p></blockquote>

here to people who lived near Metz in Lorraine, it may be conjectured that
we are to understand not <i>Coccus radicum</i>, but <i>Coccus arborum</i>, which they
might have procured from thence. For this doubt, however, there is no

dearer than unsifted. It is often adulterated in Spain, but oftener in
Holland, with the wild cochineal, as it is called. Some years ago an Englishman
adulterated this article by mixing it with red wax; but the fraud
required too laborious preparation, and was attended with too little profit

they employed it only for giving the ground of their purple, and on that
account it must have appeared improbable to them that the people in India
could produce by it a more beautiful colour than their purple was. From
the like ignorance in modern times, indigo was decried, because people
imagined that a complete colour could not be communicated by it; and
this false conclusion retarded many improvements in the art of dyeing. It
is very likely that the Greeks and the Romans were unacquainted with the
effect produced upon kermes by acids, which the Persians and Indians
used.</p></div>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="writing">WRITING-PENS.</h2>

<p>As long as people wrote upon tables covered with wax, they
were obliged to use a style or bodkin made of bone, metal, or
some other hard substance; but when they began to write
with coloured liquids, they employed a reed, and afterwards
quills or feathers. This is well-known, and has been proved
by various <span class="locked">authors<a name="FNanchor_1208" id="FNanchor_1208" href="#Footnote_1208" class="fnanchor">1208</a></span>. There are two circumstances however
in regard to this subject, which require some further research;
and which I shall endeavour to illustrate by such information
as I have been able to collect. With what kind of reeds did
people write? When, and where were feathers first employed
and for that purpose?</p>

<p>It is rather astonishing that we are ignorant of what kind of
reeds the ancients used for writing, though they have mentioned
the places where they grew wild, and where, it is highly
probable, they grow still. Besides, we have reason to suppose
that the same reeds are used even at present by all the Oriental
nations; for it is well known, that among the people of the
East old manners and instruments are not easily banished by
new modes and new inventions. Most authors who have
treated on the history of writing have contented themselves
with informing their readers that a reed was employed; but
the genus of plants called by the ancients <i>Calamus</i> and <i>Arundo</i>,
is more numerous in species than the genus of grasses, to which
their corn belonged; and it might perhaps be as difficult to
determine with accuracy what kind of reed they employed for
writing, as to distinguish the species of grain called <i>far</i>, <i>alica</i>,
and <i>avena</i>.</p>

<p>The most beautiful reeds of this kind grew formerly in
<span class="locked">Egypt<a name="FNanchor_1209" id="FNanchor_1209" href="#Footnote_1209" class="fnanchor">1209</a></span>; near Cnidus, a city and district in the province of
Caria, in Asia <span class="locked">Minor<a name="FNanchor_1210" id="FNanchor_1210" href="#Footnote_1210" class="fnanchor">1210</a></span>; and likewise in Armenia and <span class="locked">Italy<a name="FNanchor_1211" id="FNanchor_1211" href="#Footnote_1211" class="fnanchor">1211</a></span>.
Those which grew in the last-mentioned country, seem to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>
have been considered by Pliny as too soft and spongy: but his
words are so obscure that little can be gathered from them;
and though the above places have been explored in later times
by many experienced botanists, they have not supplied us with
much certain information respecting this species of reed. It
is however particularly mentioned by the old botanists, who
have represented it as a stem, such as I have seen in collections;
but as they give no characters sufficiently precise, Linnæus
was not able to assign any place in his system to the <i>Arundo
scriptoria</i> of <span class="locked">Bauhin<a name="FNanchor_1212" id="FNanchor_1212" href="#Footnote_1212" class="fnanchor">1212</a></span>.</p>

<p>Chardin speaks of the reeds which grow in the marshes of
Persia, and which are sold and much sought after in the Levant,
particularly for writing. He has even described them;
but his account has been of no service to enlarge our botanical
<span class="locked">knowledge<a name="FNanchor_1213" id="FNanchor_1213" href="#Footnote_1213" class="fnanchor">1213</a></span>. Tournefort, who saw them collected in the neighbourhood
of Teflis, the capital of Georgia, though his description
of them is far from complete, has taught us more than any
of his predecessors. We learn from his account, that this reed
has small leaves, that it rises only to the height of a man, and
that it is not hollow, but filled with a soft spongy substance.
He has characterized it, therefore, in the following manner in
his System of Botany: Arundo orientalis, tenuifolia, caule
pleno, ex qua Turcæ calamos <span class="locked">parant<a name="FNanchor_1214" id="FNanchor_1214" href="#Footnote_1214" class="fnanchor">1214</a></span>. The same words are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>
applied to it by Miller; but he observes that no plants of it
had ever been introduced into England. That the best
writing-reeds are procured from the southern provinces of
Persia is confirmed by Dapper and Hanway. The former
says that the reeds are sown and planted near the Persian Gulf
in the place mentioned by Chardin, and he gives the same
description as that traveller of the manner in which they are
prepared.</p>

<p>The circumstance expressly mentioned by Tournefort, that
these writing-reeds are not entirely hollow, seems to agree
perfectly with the account given by <span class="locked">Dioscorides<a name="FNanchor_1215" id="FNanchor_1215" href="#Footnote_1215" class="fnanchor">1215</a></span>. It is
probable that the pith dries and becomes shrunk, especially
after the preparation described by Chardin, so that the reed
can be easily freed from it in the same manner as the marrowy
substance in writing-quills is removed from them when
prepared. Something of the like kind seems to be meant by
Pliny, who, in my opinion, says that the pith dried up within
the reed, which was hollow at the lower end, but at the
upper end woody and destitute of pith. What follows refers
to the flowers, which were employed instead of feathers
for beds, and also for caulking ships. I conjectured
that Forskal had given an accurate description of this reed;
but when I consulted that author, I did not find what I expected.
He only confirms that a great many reeds of different
kinds grow near the Nile, which serve to make hedges,
thatch, and wattled-walls, and which are used for various other
<span class="locked">purposes<a name="FNanchor_1216" id="FNanchor_1216" href="#Footnote_1216" class="fnanchor">1216</a></span>.</p>

<p>These reeds were split and formed to a point like our quills,
but certainly it was not possible to make so clean and fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>
strokes, and to write so <span class="locked">long<a name="FNanchor_1217" id="FNanchor_1217" href="#Footnote_1217" class="fnanchor">1217</a></span> and so conveniently with them
as one can with quills. The use of them, however, was not
entirely abandoned when people began to write with quills,
which in every country can be procured from an animal extremely
useful in many other respects. Had the ancients been
acquainted with the art of employing goose-quills for this purpose,
they would undoubtedly have dedicated to Minerva, not
the owl, but the goose.</p>

<p>A passage in Clemens of Alexandria, who died in the beginning
of the third century, might on the first view induce
one to conjecture that the Egyptian priests even wrote with
quills. This author, after describing a procession of these
priests, says the sacred writer had in his hand a book with
writing-instruments, and on his head <span class="locked">feathers<a name="FNanchor_1218" id="FNanchor_1218" href="#Footnote_1218" class="fnanchor">1218</a></span>. But it is impossible
to guess what might be the intention of these feathers
or wings on the head, among a people who were so fond of
symbols. Besides, Clemens tells us expressly, that one of the
writing-instruments was a reed with which the priests used to
write.</p>

<p>Some assert from a passage of <span class="locked">Juvenal<a name="FNanchor_1219" id="FNanchor_1219" href="#Footnote_1219" class="fnanchor">1219</a></span>, that quills were
used for writing in the time of that poet; but what he says is
only a metaphorical expression, such as has been employed by
<span class="locked">Horace<a name="FNanchor_1220" id="FNanchor_1220" href="#Footnote_1220" class="fnanchor">1220</a></span> and various ancient writers. Others have endeavoured
to prove the antiquity of writing-quills from the figure
of the goddess Egeria, who is represented with a book before
her, and a feather in her right hand; but the period when this
Egeria was formed is not known, and it is probable that the
feather was added by some modern <span class="locked">artist<a name="FNanchor_1221" id="FNanchor_1221" href="#Footnote_1221" class="fnanchor">1221</a></span>. No drawings in
manuscripts, where the authors appear with quills, are of great
antiquity. Among these is the portrait of Aristotle, in a manuscript
in the library of Vienna, which, as expressly mentioned
at the end, was drawn at Rome in the year 1457; and
we have great reason to think that the artist delineated the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>
figure for ornamenting his work, not after an ancient painting,
but from his own <span class="locked">imagination<a name="FNanchor_1222" id="FNanchor_1222" href="#Footnote_1222" class="fnanchor">1222</a></span>.</p>

<p>If credit can be given to the anonymous author of the
history of Constantius, extracts from which have been made
known by Adrian de Valois, the use of quills for writing is as
old as the fifth century. We are informed by this author, who
lived in the above century, that Theodoric, king of the Ostrogoths,
was so illiterate and stupid, that during the ten years of
his reign he was not able to learn to write four letters at the
bottom of his edicts. For this reason the four letters were cut
for him in a plate of gold, and the plate being laid upon paper,
he then traced out the letters with a <span class="locked">quill<a name="FNanchor_1223" id="FNanchor_1223" href="#Footnote_1223" class="fnanchor">1223</a></span>. This account is,
at any rate, not improbable; for history supplies us with more
instances of such men not destined for the throne by nature,
but raised to it either by hereditary right or by accident, who
had neither abilities nor inclination for those studies which
it requires. The western empire was governed, almost about
the time of Theodoric, by the emperor Justin, who also could
not write, and who used in the like manner a piece of wood,
having letters cut in it, but with this difference, that, in tracing
them out, he caused his hand to be guided by one of his <span class="locked">secretaries<a name="FNanchor_1224" id="FNanchor_1224" href="#Footnote_1224" class="fnanchor">1224</a></span>.</p>

<p>The oldest certain account however known at present respecting
writing-quills, is a passage of Isidore, who died in
the year 636, and who, among the instruments employed for
writing, mentions reeds and <span class="locked">feathers<a name="FNanchor_1225" id="FNanchor_1225" href="#Footnote_1225" class="fnanchor">1225</a></span>. Another proof of quills
being used in the same century, is a small poem on a writing-pen,
to be found in the works of Althelmus, called sometimes
also Aldhelmus, Adelhemus, and Adelmus. This writer, descended
of a noble family, was the first Saxon who wrote Latin,
and who made the art of Latin poetry known to his countrymen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span>
and inspired them with a taste for compositions of that
kind. He died in the year <span class="locked">709<a name="FNanchor_1226" id="FNanchor_1226" href="#Footnote_1226" class="fnanchor">1226</a></span>.</p>

<p>In the eighth century writing-pens are mentioned by Alcuin,
who at that period, in the time of Charlemagne, was of service
in extending literary knowledge. He composed poetical inscriptions
for every part of a monastery, among which there is
one even for a <span class="locked">privy<a name="FNanchor_1227" id="FNanchor_1227" href="#Footnote_1227" class="fnanchor">1227</a></span>, and another for a writing-study. Speaking
of the latter, he says that no one ought to talk in it, lest
the pen of the transcriber should commit a <span class="locked">mistake<a name="FNanchor_1228" id="FNanchor_1228" href="#Footnote_1228" class="fnanchor">1228</a></span>.</p>

<p>After the above period proofs occur which place the matter
beyond all doubt. Mabillon saw a manuscript of the gospels,
which had been written in the ninth century under the reign of
Louis I., in which the evangelists were represented with quills
in their hands. The same author mentions a like figure of the
eleventh <span class="locked">century<a name="FNanchor_1229" id="FNanchor_1229" href="#Footnote_1229" class="fnanchor">1229</a></span>. In the twelfth century, Peter de Clugny,
who by scholastic writers is called <i>Venerabilis</i>, and who died
in 1157, wrote to a friend, exhorting him to assume the pen
instead of the plough, and to transcribe, instead of tilling
<span class="locked">land<a name="FNanchor_1230" id="FNanchor_1230" href="#Footnote_1230" class="fnanchor">1230</a></span>. In short, writing-quills are often called <i>calami</i> by ancient
and modern authors who wrote good Latin; and it is
probable that this word is employed by older writers than
Isidore to signify writing-pens, where, for want of other proofs,
we understand reeds.</p>

<p>The poet <span class="locked">Heerkens<a name="FNanchor_1231" id="FNanchor_1231" href="#Footnote_1231" class="fnanchor">1231</a></span> has asserted, that the use of quills for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>
writing is much older, and that the Romans became acquainted
with them during their residence in the Netherlands, where
they could not easily procure Egyptian reeds, and where, according
to the account of <span class="locked">Pliny<a name="FNanchor_1232" id="FNanchor_1232" href="#Footnote_1232" class="fnanchor">1232</a></span>, they paid so much attention
to the catching of geese. That writer, however, says that
this was done on account of the flesh of these animals, which
they esteemed much when roasted, and of the softness of their
feathers, on which they were fond of sleeping. Heerkens
himself remarks, that Pliny, had he known the use of quills
for writing, would not have passed it over in silence, when he
gives so circumstantial an account of writing-reeds. He is of
opinion also, that, as the Dutch terms of art which allude to
writing, such as <i>schryfpen</i>, &amp;c., are of Latin extraction, the
Dutch must have acquired them as well as the things signified
from the Romans. This however seems to afford very little
support to his assertion. Of more importance is the observation
that in an old and beautiful manuscript of Virgil, in the
Medicean library, which was written soon after the time of
Honorius, the thickness of the strokes, and the gradual fineness
of the hair-strokes of the letters give us reason to conjecture
that they must have been written by some instrument
equally elastic as a quill, as it is not probable that such strokes
could be made with a stiff <span class="locked">reed<a name="FNanchor_1233" id="FNanchor_1233" href="#Footnote_1233" class="fnanchor">1233</a></span>. It is also certain that the
letters of the greater part of ancient manuscripts, particularly
those found at Herculaneum, are written in a much stiffer and
more uniform manner. But little confidence is to be placed
in this observation; for we do not know but the ancient artists
may have been acquainted with some method of giving elasticity
to their reeds, and may have employed them in such a
manner as to produce beautiful writing.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the great advantage which quills have over
reeds for writing, the latter however seem to have continued
long in use even with the former. This conclusion I do not
form, because <i>calamus</i> and <i>arundo</i> are to be found in the works
of late writers; for many authors may have employed these
old Latin words to express quills, like Cassiodorus, who in the
sixth century, when exhorting the monks to transcribe theological
works, used both these terms <span class="locked">indiscriminately<a name="FNanchor_1234" id="FNanchor_1234" href="#Footnote_1234" class="fnanchor">1234</a></span>; but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>
found my assertion on the testimony of diplomatists, and particularly
on the undoubted mention made of writing-reeds in
the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>Men of letters, well-versed in diplomatics, assure us, from
comparing manuscripts, that writing-reeds were used along
with quills in the eighth century, at least in France, and that
the latter first began to be common in the ninth. The papal
acts, and those of synods, must however have been written
with reeds much <span class="locked">later<a name="FNanchor_1235" id="FNanchor_1235" href="#Footnote_1235" class="fnanchor">1235</a></span>. In convents they were retained for
texts and initials, while, for small writing, quills were everywhere
employed.</p>

<p>I can allow little credit to a conjecture supported merely
by a similarity of the strokes in writing, because it is probable
that people at first would endeavour to write in as strong
and coarse a manner with quills, as had been before done with
reeds, in order that the writing might not seem much different
from what was usual; and with quills one can produce writing
both coarse and fine. M. Meiners, however, referred me to a
passage in a letter of Reuchlin, which removes all doubt on
the subject. When this worthy man, to whom posterity is
so much indebted, was obliged to fly by the cruelty of his
enemies, famine and the plague, and to leave behind him all
his property, he was supplied with the most common necessaries
by <span class="locked">Pirkheimer<a name="FNanchor_1236" id="FNanchor_1236" href="#Footnote_1236" class="fnanchor">1236</a></span>. Among other articles the latter sent to
him, in the year 1520, writing materials, good paper, pen-knives,
and, instead of peacocks-feathers which he had requested,
the best swan-quills. That nothing might be wanting,
he added also proper reeds, of so excellent a sort, that
Reuchlin considered them to be Egyptian or <span class="locked">Cnidian<a name="FNanchor_1237" id="FNanchor_1237" href="#Footnote_1237" class="fnanchor">1237</a></span>.</p>

<p>These reeds at that period must have been scarce and in
great request, as it appears by some letters of Erasmus to
Reuchlin, for my knowledge of which I am under obligations
to M. Meiners, that the former received three reeds from the
latter, and expressed a wish that Reuchlin, when he procured
more, would send some of them to a learned man in England,
who was a common friend to <span class="locked">both<a name="FNanchor_1238" id="FNanchor_1238" href="#Footnote_1238" class="fnanchor">1238</a></span>.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been the cause, about the year 1433<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span>
writing-quills were so scarce at Venice, that it was with great
difficulty men of letters could procure them. We learn at
any rate, that the well-known Ambrosius Traversarius, a monk
of Camaldule, sent from Venice to his brother, in the above
year, a bunch of quills, together with a letter, in which he
said, “They are not the best, but such as I received in a present.
Show the whole bunch to our friend Nicholas, that he
may select a quill; for these articles are indeed scarcer in this
city than at <span class="locked">Florence<a name="FNanchor_1239" id="FNanchor_1239" href="#Footnote_1239" class="fnanchor">1239</a></span>.” This Ambrosius complains likewise,
that at the same period he had hardly any more ink, and requested
that a small vessel filled with it might be sent to <span class="locked">him<a name="FNanchor_1240" id="FNanchor_1240" href="#Footnote_1240" class="fnanchor">1240</a></span>.
Other learned men complain also of the want of good ink,
which they either would not or did not know how to make.
Those even who deal in it seldom know of what ingredients it
is principally composed.</p>

<p>[The softness of quill pens and the constant trouble required
to mend them naturally led to the search for some substitute.
Metals have supplied this, and the manufacture of metallic
pens now gives occupation to an immense number of persons.
Steel and other metallic pens have long been made <span class="locked">occasionally<a name="FNanchor_1241" id="FNanchor_1241" href="#Footnote_1241" class="fnanchor">1241</a></span>,
but were not extensively used on account of their stiffness;
this was remedied by Mr. Perry, who, in 1830, introduced the
use of apertures between the shoulder and the point. Numerous
other improvements have been made, the metals have all had
a trial, and pens can now be obtained of almost every form
and quality. Perhaps the most perfect and durable, although
the most expensive, are those in which the pen is made of gold,
with a nib of osmium and iridium. The total quantity of steel
annually employed in the manufacture of pens has been estimated
at 120 tons, from which upwards of 200,000,000 pens
are produced. One Birmingham manufacturer employed in
1838, 300 persons in making steel pens. They are also extensively
manufactured in London and Sheffield. When first
introduced, steel pens were eight shillings a gross; they afterwards
fell to four shillings a gross, and now they are procured
at Birmingham for fourpence a <span class="locked">gross<a name="FNanchor_1242" id="FNanchor_1242" href="#Footnote_1242" class="fnanchor">1242</a></span>!]</p>

with water by the river Hellé, a place of Arabia formed by an arm of
the Tigris, and another of the Euphrates united. They are cut in March,
and, when gathered, are tied up in bundles and laid for six months under
a dunghill, where they harden and assume a beautiful polish and lively
colour, which is a mixture of yellow and black. None of these reeds are
collected in any other place. As they make the best writing-pens, they

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="wire">WIRE-DRAWING.</h2>

<p>It is highly probable that in early periods metals were beat
with a hammer to thin plates or leaves, which were afterwards
divided into small slips by means of a pair of scissors, or some
other instrument; and that these slips were by a hammer and
file then rounded, so as to form threads or wire. This conjecture
seems to be confirmed by the oldest information respecting
work of this kind. When the sacerdotal dress of
Aaron was prepared, the gold was beaten and cut to threads,
so that it could be interwoven in <span class="locked">cloth<a name="FNanchor_1243" id="FNanchor_1243" href="#Footnote_1243" class="fnanchor">1243</a></span>. We are told also
that Vulcan, desirous to expose Mars and Venus, while engaged
in their illicit amour, repaired to his forge, and formed
on his anvil, with hammers and files, a net so fine that it could
be perceived by no one, not even by the gods themselves, for
it was as delicate as a spider’s <span class="locked">web<a name="FNanchor_1244" id="FNanchor_1244" href="#Footnote_1244" class="fnanchor">1244</a></span>. These fine threads therefore
were at that time first beat upon the anvil, and afterwards
rounded by a file, but were not drawn out like our wire. I
do not remember to have found a single passage in ancient
authors where mention is made of metal prepared by being
wire-drawn. The <i>æs ductile</i> of Pliny was so called because it
was malleable, and could be beat into thin leaves; and he says
“tenuatur in <span class="locked">laminas<a name="FNanchor_1245" id="FNanchor_1245" href="#Footnote_1245" class="fnanchor">1245</a></span>.” In my opinion, works made with threads
of metal occur too seldom in the writings of the ancients, to
allow us to suppose that they were acquainted with that easy
and cheap method of forming these threads by wire-drawing.
Wire-work is rarely mentioned, and wherever it is spoken of,
it appears to have been prepared on the anvil.</p>

<p>Such threads of the dearest and most malleable metal, gold,
seem to have been early employed for ornamenting different
articles of dress, but certainly not in so ingenious and beautiful
a manner as in modern times. It is probable that slips of
gold were sewed upon clothes, and particularly on the seams,
as is still practised with lace; and perhaps gold stars and
other figures cut from thin plates of gold were applied to
dresses in the same manner, as is the case at present with
spangles, and perhaps they were only affixed to them with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span>
paste. People however soon began to weave or knit dresses
entirely of gold threads, without the addition of any other materials;
at least such seems to be the account given by <span class="locked">Pliny<a name="FNanchor_1246" id="FNanchor_1246" href="#Footnote_1246" class="fnanchor">1246</a></span>.
Of this kind was the mantle taken from the statue of Jupiter
by the tyrant <span class="locked">Dionysius<a name="FNanchor_1247" id="FNanchor_1247" href="#Footnote_1247" class="fnanchor">1247</a></span>, and the tunic of Heliogabalus mentioned
by <span class="locked">Lampridius<a name="FNanchor_1248" id="FNanchor_1248" href="#Footnote_1248" class="fnanchor">1248</a></span>. These consisted of real <i>drap d’or</i>, but
the moderns give that name to cloth, the threads of which are
silk wound round with silver wire flattened and gilded.</p>

<p>The invention of interweaving such massy gold threads in
cloth is by Pliny ascribed to king Attalus; but I consider it
to be much older, though I have found no certain proofs to
support this opinion. I conjecture that the cloth of Attalus,
so much extolled on account of its magnificence, was embroidered
with the needle; for in the passage where embroidery
is mentioned by Pliny for the first time, he speaks of its being
invented by the Phrygians; he then mentions the cloth of
Attalus; and immediately after the Babylonian, which, as is
proved by several expressions in ancient authors, was certainly
embroidered with the <span class="locked">needle<a name="FNanchor_1249" id="FNanchor_1249" href="#Footnote_1249" class="fnanchor">1249</a></span>. If I am not mistaken,
Attalus first caused woollen cloth to be embroidered (not interwoven)
with threads of gold; and the doubt that Pliny
assigns too late a period to the interweaving cloth with threads
of gold is entirely removed. It appears that in the third century
gold was interwoven with linen, that linen was embroidered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">416</a></span>
with gold threads, or that gold threads were sewed upon
linen, which the emperor Alexander Severus considered as
folly; because by these means the linen was rendered stiff,
cumbersome and <span class="locked">inconvenient<a name="FNanchor_1250" id="FNanchor_1250" href="#Footnote_1250" class="fnanchor">1250</a></span>.</p>

<p>It was not till a much later period that silver began to be
formed into threads by a like process, and to be interwoven
in cloth. Salmasius and Goguet have already remarked that
no mention of silver stuffs is to be found in the works of the
ancients; for the passages which might be quoted from Homer
speak only, without doubt, of white <span class="locked">garments<a name="FNanchor_1251" id="FNanchor_1251" href="#Footnote_1251" class="fnanchor">1251</a></span>. Pliny certainly
would not have omitted this manner of preparing silver,
had it been usual in his time; especially as he treats so expressly
of that metal, and its being employed for ornaments,
and speaks of gold threads and embroidering with gold. Vopiscus,
however, seems to afford us an indubitable proof that
silver thread was not known in the time of the emperor <span class="locked">Aurelian<a name="FNanchor_1252" id="FNanchor_1252" href="#Footnote_1252" class="fnanchor">1252</a></span>.
This author informs us that the emperor was desirous
of entirely abolishing the use of gold for gilding and weaving,
because, though there was more gold than silver, the former
had become scarcer, as a great deal of it was lost by being
applied to the above purposes, whereas every thing that was
silver continued <span class="locked">so<a name="FNanchor_1253" id="FNanchor_1253" href="#Footnote_1253" class="fnanchor">1253</a></span>; but it has been fully proved by Salmasius
that silver threads were interwoven in cloth in the time of
the last Greek <span class="locked">emperors<a name="FNanchor_1254" id="FNanchor_1254" href="#Footnote_1254" class="fnanchor">1254</a></span>.</p>

<p>The period when attempts were first made to draw into
threads metal cut or beat into small slips, by forcing them
through holes in a steel plate placed perpendicularly on a table,
I cannot determine. In the time of Charlemagne this process
was not known in Italy; for however unintelligible may be
the directions given in <span class="locked">Muratori<a name="FNanchor_1255" id="FNanchor_1255" href="#Footnote_1255" class="fnanchor">1255</a></span>, “de fila aurea facere, de petalis
auri et argenti,” we learn from them that these articles
were formed only by the hammer. It is extremely probable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span>
that the first experiments in wire-drawing were made upon
the most ductile metals, and that the drawing of brass and
iron to wire is of later date. It is likewise certain that the
metal was at first drawn by the hand of the workman; in the
same manner as wire is drawn by our pin-makers when they
are desirous of rendering it finer. They wind it off from one
cylinder upon another, by which means it is forced through
the holes of the drawing-iron; and this process agrees perfectly
with the description of <span class="locked">Vanuccio<a name="FNanchor_1256" id="FNanchor_1256" href="#Footnote_1256" class="fnanchor">1256</a></span> and <span class="locked">Garzoni<a name="FNanchor_1257" id="FNanchor_1257" href="#Footnote_1257" class="fnanchor">1257</a></span>, as well
as with the figures in the German translation of the latter.</p>

<p>As long as the work was performed by the hammer, the
artists at Nuremberg were called wire-smiths; but after the
invention of the drawing-iron they were called wire-drawers
and wire-millers. Both these appellations occur in the history
of Augsburg so early as the year 1351; and in that of Nuremberg
in <span class="locked">1360<a name="FNanchor_1258" id="FNanchor_1258" href="#Footnote_1258" class="fnanchor">1258</a></span>; so that, according to the best information
I have been able to obtain, I must class the invention of the
drawing-iron, or proper wire-drawing, among those of the
fourteenth century.</p>

<p>At first threads exceedingly massy were employed for
weaving and embroidering. Among the ruins of Herculaneum
were found massy gold tassels, the threads of which were
wound neither round silk nor any other <span class="locked">materials<a name="FNanchor_1259" id="FNanchor_1259" href="#Footnote_1259" class="fnanchor">1259</a></span>. It would
be of some importance if one could determine the period when
flatted metal wire began to be spun round linen or silk thread,
by which improvement various articles of dress and ornament
are rendered more beautiful as well as cheaper. The spinning-mill,
by which this labour is performed at present, is so ingeniously
contrived that the name of the inventor deserves to be
made <span class="locked">immortal<a name="FNanchor_1260" id="FNanchor_1260" href="#Footnote_1260" class="fnanchor">1260</a></span>.</p>

<p>It appears that the wire first spun about thread was round;
and the invention of previously making the wire flat is, in my
opinion, a new epoch in the history of this art. Three times
as much silk can be covered by flatted as by round wire; so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>
that tassels and other articles become cheap in proportion.
Besides, the brightness of the metal is heightened in an uncommon
degree; and the article becomes much more <span class="locked">beautiful<a name="FNanchor_1261" id="FNanchor_1261" href="#Footnote_1261" class="fnanchor">1261</a></span>.
The wire is flatted at present by means of a flatting-mill,
which consists of two steel cylinders, put in motion by a
handle, and as the wire passes through between them it is
compressed and rendered flat. These cylinders were at first
procured from the Milanese, and afterwards from Schwarzenbruck
in Saxony; but since the death of the artists in those
parts who were acquainted with the secret of making them,
they have generally been ordered from Neufchatel. A pair
of them cost two hundred dollars. The whole art, however,
seems to consist in giving a proper hardness to the steel and
in polishing them. In the earliest ages wire was flatted with
a hammer on the anvil; and the broad slips were cut into
small threads by women with a pair of scissors. The process
is thus described by Vannuccio and Garzoni, without mentioning
the flatting-mill which is now used for brass work, coining
money, and various other purposes.</p>

<p>Before I proceed to the newest inventions I shall add the
following observations. Of the wire-work of the ancients we
have very few remains, and these are to be found upon cast
statues, on which one cannot expect any fine wire spun or entwisted
round other substances, even supposing that they had
such. In the museum at Portici, which contains a variety of
articles discovered at Herculaneum, there are three metal
heads, with locks in imitation of hair. One of them has fifty
locks made of wire as thick as a quill, bent into the form of a
curl. On the other the locks are flat like small slips of paper
which have been rolled together with the fingers, and afterwards
<span class="locked">disentangled<a name="FNanchor_1262" id="FNanchor_1262" href="#Footnote_1262" class="fnanchor">1262</a></span>. A Venus, a span in height, has on the
arms and legs golden <span class="locked">bracelets<a name="FNanchor_1263" id="FNanchor_1263" href="#Footnote_1263" class="fnanchor">1263</a></span> (<i>armillæ et periscelides</i>), which
are formed of wire twisted round them. Grignon found in
the ruins of a Roman city in Champagne a piece of gold thread
which was a line in <span class="locked">thickness<a name="FNanchor_1264" id="FNanchor_1264" href="#Footnote_1264" class="fnanchor">1264</a></span>. Among the insignia of the
German empire is the sword of St. Maurice, the handle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>
which is wood bound round with strong silver <span class="locked">wire<a name="FNanchor_1265" id="FNanchor_1265" href="#Footnote_1265" class="fnanchor">1265</a></span>. The
ancients, however, must have been acquainted at an early
period with the art of making gold-wire of considerable fineness,
as they used it in weaving and for embroidery. When
surgeons were desirous to fasten a loose tooth or to implant
one of ivory in the room of one that had dropped out, they
bound it to the next one by a piece of fine gold <span class="locked">wire<a name="FNanchor_1266" id="FNanchor_1266" href="#Footnote_1266" class="fnanchor">1266</a></span>.</p>

<p>The greatest improvement ever made in this art was undoubtedly
the invention of the large drawing-machine, which
is driven by water, and in which the axle-tree, by means of a
lever, moves a pair of pincers, that open as they fall against
the drawing-plate; lay old of the wire, which is guided through
a hole of the plate; shut as they are drawn back; and in that
manner pull the wire along with <span class="locked">them<a name="FNanchor_1267" id="FNanchor_1267" href="#Footnote_1267" class="fnanchor">1267</a></span>. What a pity that
neither the inventor nor the time when this machine was invented
is known! It is, however, more than probable that it
was first constructed at Nuremberg by a person named Rudolf,
who kept it long a secret; and by these means acquired a
considerable fortune. Conrade Celtes, who wrote about the
year 1491, is the only author known at present who confirms
this information; and he tells us that the son of the inventor,
seduced by avaricious people, discovered to them the whole
secret of the machinery; which so incensed the father that he
would have put him to death, had he not saved himself by
<span class="locked">flight<a name="FNanchor_1268" id="FNanchor_1268" href="#Footnote_1268" class="fnanchor">1268</a></span>. Von Murr, however, has not been able to find any
proofs of this circumstance; and amongst the names of wire-drawers,
which he met with in the records of Nuremberg, it
appears that there must have been no Rudolf, else he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span>
certainly have mentioned it. <span class="locked">Doppelmayer<a name="FNanchor_1269" id="FNanchor_1269" href="#Footnote_1269" class="fnanchor">1269</a></span>, from mere conjecture,
places Rudolf’s invention in the year 1400; but Von
Murr makes it older, because he found in the year 1360 the
name Schockenzier, which signifies a person who works at
wire-drawing.</p>

<p>This art, it appears, was brought to the greatest perfection
at Nuremberg. Several improvements were from time to time
found out by different persons, who turned them to their advantage,
and who received exclusive patents for using them,
sometimes from the emperor, and sometimes from the council,
and which gave occasion to many tedious law-suits. We have,
however, reason to believe that the finer kinds of work, particularly
in gold and silver, were carried on with great success,
above all, in France and Italy; and that many improvements
were brought from these countries to Germany. I have not
materials sufficient to enable me to give a complete account
of the progress of the art of wire-drawing at Nuremberg; but
it affords me pleasure that I can communicate some important
information on this subject, which was <span class="locked">published<a name="FNanchor_1270" id="FNanchor_1270" href="#Footnote_1270" class="fnanchor">1270</a></span> by Dr. F.
C. G. Hirsching of Erlangen, taken from original papers,
respecting the wire-drawing manufactory at <span class="locked">Nuremberg<a name="FNanchor_1271" id="FNanchor_1271" href="#Footnote_1271" class="fnanchor">1271</a></span>, and
which I shall here insert.</p>

<p>In the year 1570, a Frenchman named Anthony Fournier,
first brought to Nuremberg the art of drawing wire exceedingly
fine, and made considerable improvement in the apparatus
used for that purpose. In 1592 Frederick Hagelsheimer,
called also Held, a citizen of Nuremberg, began to prepare, with
much benefit to himself, fine gold and silver wire, such as
could be used for spinning round silk and for weaving, and
which before that period had been manufactured only in Italy
and France. Held removed his manufactory from France to
Nuremberg, and received from the magistrates an exclusive
patent, by which no other person was allowed to make or
to imitate the fine works which he manufactured, for the term
of fifteen years. On account of the large capital and great
labour which was required to establish this manufactory, his
patent was by the same magistrates continued in 1607 for fifteen
years more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span>
As this patent comprehended only fine work, and the city
of Nuremberg, and as works of copper gilt with silver or gold
were of great importance, he obtained on the 19th of March,
1608, from the emperor Rodolphus II., an extension of his
patent, in which these works were included, and by which
power was granted to him to seize, in any part of the empire,
as well as in Nuremberg, imitations of his manufactures made
by others, or such of his workmen as might be enticed from
his service. A prolongation of his patent for fifteen years was
again granted to him at the same time.</p>

<p>After the death of the emperor Rodolphus, his patent was
in everything renewed, on the 29th of September, 1612, by
the emperor Matthias, and extended to the term of fifteen
years more. On the 16th of June, 1621, the Nuremberg
patent expired; and the same year the family of Held, with
consent of the magistrates of that city, entered into an agreement,
in regard to wages and other regulations, with the
master wire-drawers and <span class="locked">piece-workers<a name="FNanchor_1272" id="FNanchor_1272" href="#Footnote_1272" class="fnanchor">1272</a></span>, which was confirmed
in another patent granted to Held on the 28th of September,
1621, by the emperor Ferdinand II., agreeably to the tenor of
the two patents before-mentioned, and which was still continued
for fifteen years longer. On the 26th of September, 1622, this
patent, by advice of the imperial council, and without any
opposition, was converted into a fief to the heirs male of the
family of <span class="locked">Held<a name="FNanchor_1273" id="FNanchor_1273" href="#Footnote_1273" class="fnanchor">1273</a></span>, renewable at the expiration of the term specified
in the patent.</p>

<p>It appears that in the fifteenth century, there were flatting-mills
in several other places as well as at Nuremberg. In the
town-books of Augsburg there occurs, under the year 1351,
the name of a person called Chunr. Tratmuller de Tratmul,
who certainly seems to have been a wire-drawer. In 1545,
Andrew Schulz brought to that city the art of wire-drawing
gold and silver, which he had learned in Italy. Before this
period that art was little known in Germany; and Von Stetten
mentions an imperial police ordinance of the year 1548,
in which gold fringes are reckoned among those wares for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span>
which large sums were at that time sent out of the empire.
Schulz obtained a patent from the council, but his attempt
proved unsuccessful. The business, however, was undertaken
afterwards in Augsburg by others, and in particular by an opulent
mercantile family named Hopfer, who bestowed great pains
to establish it on a permanent footing. For this purpose they
invited from Venice, Gabriel Marteningi and his son Vincent,
who were excellent workmen and had great experience in the
art. George Geyer, who learned under them, was the first
person who introduced the flatting of wire at Augsburg; and
he and his son endeavoured for a long time to monopolize the
employment of wire-drawing, and to prevent other people
from engaging in it near them. In the year 1698, M. P. Ulstatt,
John George Geyer, Joseph Matti and Moriz Zech
obtained a new patent, and out of gratitude for this favour they
caused a medal to be struck, which deserves to be reckoned
among the most beautiful works of Philip Henry Muller, the
artist who cut the die.</p>

<p>In the year 1447 there was a flatting-mill at <span class="locked">Breslau<a name="FNanchor_1274" id="FNanchor_1274" href="#Footnote_1274" class="fnanchor">1274</a></span>; and
another, together with a burnishing-mill was constructed at
<span class="locked">Zwickau<a name="FNanchor_1275" id="FNanchor_1275" href="#Footnote_1275" class="fnanchor">1275</a></span> in 1506. All the wire in England was manufactured
by the hand till 1565, when the art of drawing it with
mills was introduced by <span class="locked">foreigners<a name="FNanchor_1276" id="FNanchor_1276" href="#Footnote_1276" class="fnanchor">1276</a></span>. Before that period the
English wire was bad; and the greater part of the iron-wire
used in the kingdom, as well as the instruments employed by
the wool-combers, was brought from other countries. According
to some accounts, however, this art was carried to
England at a much later period; for we are told that the first
wire-making was established at Esher by Jacob Momma and
Daniel <span class="locked">Demetrius<a name="FNanchor_1277" id="FNanchor_1277" href="#Footnote_1277" class="fnanchor">1277</a></span>. Anderson himself says that a Dutchman
constructed at Sheen, near Richmond, in 1663, the first flatting-mill
ever seen in England.</p>

<p>Iron-wire in France is called <i>fil d’ Archal</i>; and the artists
there have an idea, which is not improbable, that this appellation
took its rise from one Richard Archal, who either invented
or first established the art of drawing iron-wire in that
country. The expression <i>fil de Richard</i> is therefore used also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">423</a></span>
among the French <span class="locked">wire-drawers<a name="FNanchor_1278" id="FNanchor_1278" href="#Footnote_1278" class="fnanchor">1278</a></span>. Of this Archal, however,
we know as little as of the Nuremberg Rudolf; and Menage
will not admit the above derivation. He is of opinion that
<i>fil d’Archal</i> is compounded of the Latin words <i>filum</i> and <i>aurichalcum</i><a name="FNanchor_1279" id="FNanchor_1279" href="#Footnote_1279" class="fnanchor">1279</a>.</p>

<p>To conclude this article, I shall add a few observations respecting
filigrane works and spangles. The first name signifies
a kind of work of which one can scarcely form a proper
idea from a description. Fine gold and silver wire, often curled
or twisted in a serpentine form, and sometimes plaited, are
worked through each other and soldered together so as to
form festoons, flowers and various ornaments; and in many
places also they are frequently melted together by the blowpipe
into little balls, by which means the threads are so entwisted
as to have a most beautiful and pleasant effect. This
work was employed formerly much more than at present in
making small articles, which served rather for show than for
use; such as needle-cases, caskets to hold jewels, small boxes,
particularly shrines, decorations for the images of saints and
other church furniture. Work of this kind is called <i>filagrame</i>,
<i>filigrane</i>, <i>ouvrage de filigrane</i>; and it may be readily perceived
that these words are compounded of <i>filum</i> and <i>granum</i>.
We are told in the Encyclopédie that the Latins called this
work “opus filatim elaboratum,” but this is to be understood
as alluding to the latest Latin writers; for <i>filatim</i> occurs only
once in Lucretius, who applies it to woollen thread.</p>

<p>This art, however, is of great antiquity, and appears to have
been brought to Europe from the East. Grignon informs us
that he found some remains of such work in the ruins of the
Roman city <span class="locked">before-mentioned<a name="FNanchor_1280" id="FNanchor_1280" href="#Footnote_1280" class="fnanchor">1280</a></span>. Among church furniture we
meet with filigrane works of the middle ages. There was
lately preserved in an abbey at Paris, a cross ornamented with
filigrane work, which was made by St. Eloy, who died in 665;
and the greater part of the works of that saint are decorated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span>
in the like <span class="locked">manner<a name="FNanchor_1281" id="FNanchor_1281" href="#Footnote_1281" class="fnanchor">1281</a></span>. In the collection of relics at Hanover is
still to be seen a cross embellished with this kind of work,
which is said to be as old as the eleventh or twelfth <span class="locked">century<a name="FNanchor_1282" id="FNanchor_1282" href="#Footnote_1282" class="fnanchor">1282</a></span>.
The Turks, Armenians and Indians make at present master-pieces
of this sort, and with tools exceedingly coarse and imperfect.
Marsden extols the ingenuity of the Malays on the
same <span class="locked">account<a name="FNanchor_1283" id="FNanchor_1283" href="#Footnote_1283" class="fnanchor">1283</a></span>; and articles of the like nature, manufactured
at Deccan, are, we are told, remarkably pretty, and cost ten
times the price of the metal employed in forming <span class="locked">them<a name="FNanchor_1284" id="FNanchor_1284" href="#Footnote_1284" class="fnanchor">1284</a></span>. This
art is now neglected in Europe, and little esteemed. Augsburg,
however, a few years ago had a female artist, Maria
Euphros. Reinhard, celebrated for works of this kind, who
died in 1779. In 1765 she ornamented with filigrane work
some silver basons, which were sent to Russia for the use of
the church, and which gained her great <span class="locked">honour<a name="FNanchor_1285" id="FNanchor_1285" href="#Footnote_1285" class="fnanchor">1285</a></span>.</p>

<p>Spangles, <i>paillettes</i>, are small, thin, round leaves of metal,
pierced in the middle, which are sewed on as ornaments; and
though they are well-known, it might be difficult for those who
never saw them manufactured, or read an account of the manner
in which they are prepared, to conceive how they are
made. The wire is first twisted round a rod into the form of
a screw; it is then cut into single spiral rings, like those used
by pin-makers in forming heads to their pins; and these rings
being placed upon a smooth anvil are flattened by a smart
stroke of the hammer, so that a small hole remains in the
middle, and the ends of the wire which lie over each other
are closely united. I remember to have seen on old saddle-cloths
and horse-furniture large plates of this kind; but the
small spangles seem to be of later invention. According to
<span class="locked">Lejisugo<a name="FNanchor_1286" id="FNanchor_1286" href="#Footnote_1286" class="fnanchor">1286</a></span>, whose real name I do not know, they were first
made in the French gold and silver manufactories, and imitated
in Germany, for the first time, in the beginning of the
seventeenth century. The method of preparing them was long
kept a secret.</p>

<h2 id="buck">BUCK-WHEAT.</h2>

<p>Grasses alone, and of these the seeds only of those which are
so abundant in an eatable farinaceous substance that they deserve
to be cultivated as food to man, are properly corn. Notwithstanding
this definition, buck-wheat, which belongs to a
kind of plants that grow wild in Europe, knot-grass, water-pepper,
&amp;c., because it is sown and employed like corn, is
commonly reckoned to be corn also. Our wheat and oats,
however, were not produced from indigenous grasses, as has
been the opinion of some learned naturalists, who, nevertheless,
were not botanists; nor has buck-wheat been produced
from the above-mentioned wild <span class="locked">plants<a name="FNanchor_1287" id="FNanchor_1287" href="#Footnote_1287" class="fnanchor">1287</a></span>. Both these
assertions can be proved by the strongest botanical evidence;
and the latter is supported by historical testimony, which cannot
be adduced in regard to the proper species of corn, as
they were used before the commencement of our history.</p>

<p>Two centuries ago, when botanists studied the ancients,
and believed that they had been acquainted with and given
names to all plants, some of them maintained that buck-wheat
was their <i>ocimum</i>: others have considered it as the <i>erysimum</i>
of Theophrastus; and some as the <i>panicum</i> or <i>sesamum</i>. All
these opinions, however, are certainly false. It is indeed difficult
to determine what plant the <i>ocimum</i> of the ancients was;
but it may be easily proved that it was not buck-wheat, as
Bock or <span class="locked">Tragus<a name="FNanchor_1288" id="FNanchor_1288" href="#Footnote_1288" class="fnanchor">1288</a></span> has confidently asserted. The <i>ocimum</i>, or a
species of that name, for it seems to have been applied to
several vegetable productions, was a sweet-smelling plant,
called also, at least by later writers, <i>basilicum</i>; one kind of
<i>ocimum</i> had a thick, woody <span class="locked">root<a name="FNanchor_1289" id="FNanchor_1289" href="#Footnote_1289" class="fnanchor">1289</a></span>, and others possessed a strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">426</a></span>
medicinal <span class="locked">virtue<a name="FNanchor_1290" id="FNanchor_1290" href="#Footnote_1290" class="fnanchor">1290</a></span>. The ancient writers on agriculture give it
a place between the garden flowers and the odoriferous <span class="locked">herbs<a name="FNanchor_1291" id="FNanchor_1291" href="#Footnote_1291" class="fnanchor">1291</a></span>;
but none of these descriptions can be applied to our buck-wheat,
which is both insipid and destitute of smell. Two unintelligible
passages of an ancient writer on husbandry make
<i>ocimum</i> to have been a plant used for fodder, or rather a kind
of green fodder or meslin composed of various plants mixed
<span class="locked">together<a name="FNanchor_1292" id="FNanchor_1292" href="#Footnote_1292" class="fnanchor">1292</a></span>. The <i>erysimum</i> of Theophrastus produced seeds
which had a very hot acrid <span class="locked">taste<a name="FNanchor_1293" id="FNanchor_1293" href="#Footnote_1293" class="fnanchor">1293</a></span>; and he doubts whether it
was eaten by <span class="locked">cattle<a name="FNanchor_1294" id="FNanchor_1294" href="#Footnote_1294" class="fnanchor">1294</a></span>. Pliny says expressly that it ought to
be classed rather among medicinal plants than those of the
<span class="locked">corn-kind<a name="FNanchor_1295" id="FNanchor_1295" href="#Footnote_1295" class="fnanchor">1295</a></span>; though Theophrastus has mentioned it more than
once among the latter.</p>

<p>It is not worth the trouble to enter into an examination of
more opinions of the like kind, as several respectable writers,
who lived in the beginning of the sixteenth century, consider
buck-wheat to be a plant first introduced into Europe in their
time, though they are not all agreed in determining its native
country. John Bruyerinus, or as he was properly called, La
Bruyère-Champier, physician to Francis I., king of France, who
in the year 1530 wrote his book, often printed, De Re <span class="locked">Cibaria<a name="FNanchor_1296" id="FNanchor_1296" href="#Footnote_1296" class="fnanchor">1296</a></span>,
says that buck-wheat had been first brought to Europe a little
before that time from Greece and Asia. That well-known botanist
<span class="locked">Ruellius<a name="FNanchor_1297" id="FNanchor_1297" href="#Footnote_1297" class="fnanchor">1297</a></span>, who wrote in 1536, and Conrade <span class="locked">Heresbach<a name="FNanchor_1298" id="FNanchor_1298" href="#Footnote_1298" class="fnanchor">1298</a></span>,
who died in 1576, give the same account. The latter calls
the northern part of Asia the original country of this plant, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span>
that from which it had a little before been brought to Germany.
A nobleman of Brittany, whose book, Les Contes
<span class="locked">d’Eutrapel<a name="FNanchor_1299" id="FNanchor_1299" href="#Footnote_1299" class="fnanchor">1299</a></span>, was printed after his death in 1587, remarks occasionally,
that at the time when he wrote, buck-wheat had
been introduced into France about sixty years, and that it had
become the common food of the poor. Martin <span class="locked">Schook<a name="FNanchor_1300" id="FNanchor_1300" href="#Footnote_1300" class="fnanchor">1300</a></span> wrote
in 1661, that buck-wheat had been known in Flanders scarcely
a hundred years. The old botanists, Lobelius, the brothers
Bauhin, Matthiolus, and others, all assert that this grain was
new in <span class="locked">Europe<a name="FNanchor_1301" id="FNanchor_1301" href="#Footnote_1301" class="fnanchor">1301</a></span>. I shall here remark, that Crescentio, who
lived in the thirteenth century, and described all the then
known species of corn, makes no mention of buck-wheat. It
undoubtedly acquired this name from the likeness which its
seeds have to the fruit of the <span class="locked">beech-tree<a name="FNanchor_1302" id="FNanchor_1302" href="#Footnote_1302" class="fnanchor">1302</a></span>; and in my opinion
another name, that of <i>Heidenkorn</i> (heath-corn), by which it
is known in Germany, has been given it because it thrives best
in poor sandy soil where there is abundance of heath. From the
epithets <i>Turcicum</i> and <i>Saracenicum</i>, its native country cannot
be determined, for maize is called Turkish wheat, though
it originally came from America. I consider also as improbable
the conjecture of the learned <span class="locked">Frisch<a name="FNanchor_1303" id="FNanchor_1303" href="#Footnote_1303" class="fnanchor">1303</a></span>, that from the
word <i>Heide</i> (a heathen), an expression little known in Upper
Germany, has arisen the appellation of <i>ethnicum</i><a name="FNanchor_1304" id="FNanchor_1304" href="#Footnote_1304" class="fnanchor">1304</a>, and thence
<i>Saracenicum</i>, given to this plant, though the Bohemians call
it <i>pohanka</i>, from <i>pohan</i>, which signifies also a heathen.</p>

<p>There is reason to believe that this grain must have been
common in many parts of Germany in the fifteenth century.
In a bible, printed in Low-German, at Halberstadt, in the
year 1522, entitled Biblia Dudesch, the translator, who is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span>
known, but who is supposed to have been a catholic, translates
a passage of Isaiah, chap. xxviii. ver. 25, which Luther
translates <i>er säet spelz</i>, he soweth spelt, by the words <i>he seyet
bockwete</i>, he soweth <span class="locked">buck-wheat<a name="FNanchor_1305" id="FNanchor_1305" href="#Footnote_1305" class="fnanchor">1305</a></span>. The name <i>heydenkorn</i>
occurs in a catalogue of plants so early as the year <span class="locked">1552<a name="FNanchor_1306" id="FNanchor_1306" href="#Footnote_1306" class="fnanchor">1306</a></span>; and
Jos. Maaler, or Pictorius, has in his Dictionary, printed in octavo,
at Zurich in 1561, Heidenkorn, <i>Ocimum</i>. I find there also,
Heydel, a plant, <i>Panicum</i>. <span class="locked">Dasypodius<a name="FNanchor_1307" id="FNanchor_1307" href="#Footnote_1307" class="fnanchor">1307</a></span> likewise in his Dictionary,
of which I have the edition printed in 1537, says <i>Panicum</i>,
Butzweyss, Heydel; and in a vocabulary of the names
of plants added to it, Heydel, <i>Panicum</i>. Butz Weysz, <i>Panicum</i>.
Frisch has the word Heydel-Fench, which he explains
by Buck-wheat; and he remarks that in the Swiss dialect <i>Buch</i>
is changed into <i>Butz</i>. Ryff or Rivius, a physician who lived
in the middle of the sixteenth century, has changed <i>Buch</i> or
<i>Book</i> into <i>Bauch</i>, and such errors often arise by transforming
the High- into Low-German. It has, however, analogy in its
favour, for the long <i>o</i> of the Low-German is in High-German
often changed into <i>au</i>: for example, <i>look</i>, <i>lauch</i>; <i>schmooken</i>,
<i>smauchen</i>; <i>ook</i>, <i>auch</i>; <i>ooge</i>, <i>auge</i>. But the long <i>o</i> of the Low-German
becomes frequently the long <i>u</i> of the High-German;
as <i>good</i>, <i>gut</i>; <i>buch</i>, <i>buchbaum</i>; <i>book</i>, <i>bookbaum</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>That buck-wheat was cultivated in England about the year
1597, is proved by Gerard’s Herbal.</p>

<p>A new species of this grain has been made known of late
years, under the name of Siberian buck-wheat, which appears
by experience to have considerable advantages over the former.
It was sent from Tartary to Petersburgh by the German botanists
who travelled through that country in the beginning of
the last century; and it has thence been dispersed over all
Europe. We are however told in the new Swedish Economical
Dictionary, that it was first brought to Finland by a
soldier who had been a prisoner in <span class="locked">Tartary<a name="FNanchor_1308" id="FNanchor_1308" href="#Footnote_1308" class="fnanchor">1308</a></span>. Linnæus received
the first seeds, in 1737, from Gerber the <span class="locked">botanist<a name="FNanchor_1309" id="FNanchor_1309" href="#Footnote_1309" class="fnanchor">1309</a></span>, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">429</a></span>
described the plant in his Hortus Cliffortianus. After this it
was mentioned by <span class="locked">Ammann<a name="FNanchor_1310" id="FNanchor_1310" href="#Footnote_1310" class="fnanchor">1310</a></span>, in 1739; but it must have been
earlier known in Germany, at least in Swabia; for in 1733 it
was growing in the garden of Dr. Ehrhart, at <span class="locked">Memmingen<a name="FNanchor_1311" id="FNanchor_1311" href="#Footnote_1311" class="fnanchor">1311</a></span>.
In Siberia this plant sows itself for four or five years by the
grains that drop, but at the end of that time the land becomes
so full of tares that it is choked, and must be sown afresh.
Even in the œconomical gardens in Germany it is propagated
in the same manner; and it deserves to be remarked that it
grows wild among the corn near Arheilgen, a few miles from
Darmstadt, though it is cultivated nowhere in the neighbourhood.
Had it been indigenous there, Ehrhart might in 1733
have raised it from German seed.</p>

<p>The appellation of <i>Saracenicum</i> gives me occasion to add
the following remark: <span class="locked">Ruellius<a name="FNanchor_1312" id="FNanchor_1312" href="#Footnote_1312" class="fnanchor">1312</a></span> says, that in his time a plant
had begun to be introduced into the gardens of France, but
merely for ornament, called Saracen-millet, the seeds of which
were brought to that country about fifteen years before. This
millet, which was from five to six feet in height, was undoubtedly
a <i>Holcus</i>, and perhaps the same kind as that sought
after by us for cultivation a few years ago, under the name of
<i>Holcus sorghum</i><a name="FNanchor_1313" id="FNanchor_1313" href="#Footnote_1313" class="fnanchor">1313</a>. This <i>Holcus</i>, however, was cultivated, at
least in Italy, long before the time of Ruellius; for there is
little reason to doubt that it was the <i>Milium indicum</i> which
was brought from India to that country in the time of <span class="locked">Pliny<a name="FNanchor_1314" id="FNanchor_1314" href="#Footnote_1314" class="fnanchor">1314</a></span>.
That ancient naturalist says it was a kind of millet seven feet
high; that it had black seeds, and was productive almost beyond
what could be believed. In the time of Herodotus it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">430</a></span>
was cultivated at Babylon, but it must have been then little
known to the Greeks; for that historian would not venture to
mention its size and fertility, as he was afraid that his veracity
might be called in <span class="locked">question<a name="FNanchor_1315" id="FNanchor_1315" href="#Footnote_1315" class="fnanchor">1315</a></span>. According to his account, it
grew to be as large as a tree. It is worthy of remark, that this
kind of millet is still cultivated at Babylon, where it was seen
and admired by <span class="locked">Rauwolf<a name="FNanchor_1316" id="FNanchor_1316" href="#Footnote_1316" class="fnanchor">1316</a></span>. It is undoubtedly the monstrous
<i>Holcus</i> mentioned by Apollonius, who considered it as one of
the most remarkable productions of <span class="locked">India<a name="FNanchor_1317" id="FNanchor_1317" href="#Footnote_1317" class="fnanchor">1317</a></span>. It appears that
it continued to be cultivated by the Italians in the middle
ages; for it was described in the thirteenth century by Crescentio,
who speaks of its use and the method of rearing <span class="locked">it<a name="FNanchor_1318" id="FNanchor_1318" href="#Footnote_1318" class="fnanchor">1318</a></span>.
The seeds had some time before been brought from Italy to
Germany, and we find that it is on that account called Italian
millet. The old botanists named it also <i>Sorgsamen</i> and <i>Sorgsaat</i>;
appellations formed from <i>sorghum</i>. The name <i>Morhirse</i>,
under which it again came to us from Switzerland, in
later <span class="locked">times<a name="FNanchor_1319" id="FNanchor_1319" href="#Footnote_1319" class="fnanchor">1319</a></span>, has arisen either from the black colour of one
of the kinds, or it may signify the same as <i>Moren-hirse</i>
(Moorish-millet), because it is almost the only corn of the
sable <span class="locked">Africans<a name="FNanchor_1320" id="FNanchor_1320" href="#Footnote_1320" class="fnanchor">1320</a></span>. However this may be, it can never become
an object of common cultivation among us, for our summer is
neither sufficiently long nor sufficiently warm, to bring it to
perfection. Last summer (1787) I could with difficulty obtain
a few ripe grains for seed.</p>

<p>[The cultivation of buck-wheat has never been very extensive
in this country, as it will not bear the frosts of our
springs or the severity of winter. The only counties in which
it is grown to a moderate extent are Norfolk and Suffolk,
where it is called <i>brank</i>. If a small patch is occasionally met
with elsewhere, it is in general principally for the sake of encouraging
game, particularly pheasants, which are extremely
fond of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">431</a></span>
The seed of the buck-wheat is said to be excellent for horses,
the flowers for bees, and the plant green for soiling cows, cattle,
sheep, or swine. No grain seems so eagerly eaten by
poultry, or makes them lay eggs so soon or so abundantly.
The flour is fine and white, but from a deficiency in gluten
does not make good fermented bread; it serves well, however,
for pastry and cakes, and in Germany and Holland is extensively
used, especially by the farmers, dressed in a variety of
ways, among others as pancakes, which if eaten hot are light
and pleasant, but become very heavy as they cool. A hasty
pudding made of the flour with water or milk, and eaten with
butter and sugar, is considered a favourite dainty.]</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="saddles">SADDLES.</h2>

<p>In early ages the rider sat on the bare back of his horse without
anything under <span class="locked">him<a name="FNanchor_1321" id="FNanchor_1321" href="#Footnote_1321" class="fnanchor">1321</a></span>; but, in the course of time, some
kind of covering, which consisted often of cloth, a mattress, a
piece of leather or hide, was placed over the back of the animal.
We are informed by <span class="locked">Pliny<a name="FNanchor_1322" id="FNanchor_1322" href="#Footnote_1322" class="fnanchor">1322</a></span>, that one Pelethronius first
introduced this practice; but who that person was is not certainly
known. Such coverings became afterwards more
<span class="locked">costly<a name="FNanchor_1323" id="FNanchor_1323" href="#Footnote_1323" class="fnanchor">1323</a></span>; they were made frequently in such a manner as to
hang down on both sides of the horse, as may be seen by the
beautiful engravings in <span class="locked">Montfaucon<a name="FNanchor_1324" id="FNanchor_1324" href="#Footnote_1324" class="fnanchor">1324</a></span>, and were distinguished
among the Greeks and Romans by various <span class="locked">names<a name="FNanchor_1325" id="FNanchor_1325" href="#Footnote_1325" class="fnanchor">1325</a></span>; but even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">432</a></span>
after they were common, it was reckoned more manly to ride
without them. Varro boasts of having rode, when a young
man, without a covering to his horse; and <span class="locked">Xenophon<a name="FNanchor_1326" id="FNanchor_1326" href="#Footnote_1326" class="fnanchor">1326</a></span> reproaches
the Persians because they placed more clothes on
the backs of their horses than on their beds, and gave themselves
more trouble to sit easily than to ride skilfully. On
this account such coverings were for a long time not used in
war; and the old Germans, who considered them as disgraceful,
despised the Roman cavalry who employed <span class="locked">them<a name="FNanchor_1327" id="FNanchor_1327" href="#Footnote_1327" class="fnanchor">1327</a></span>. The
information, therefore, of Dion <span class="locked">Cassius<a name="FNanchor_1328" id="FNanchor_1328" href="#Footnote_1328" class="fnanchor">1328</a></span>, according to whom
such coverings were first allowed to the Roman cavalry by
Nero, is very doubtful. This author, perhaps, alludes only to
reviews, at which, it is probable, the cavalry were before
obliged always to appear without them. In the time of Alexander
Severus, the horses of the whole Roman cavalry had
beautiful <span class="locked">coverings<a name="FNanchor_1329" id="FNanchor_1329" href="#Footnote_1329" class="fnanchor">1329</a></span>. Saddles, however, at that period were
certainly unknown, though they afterwards obtained the old
name <i>ephippium</i>, which originally signified nothing more than a
covering for a horse. Xenophon says, a rider, whether placed
on the bare back of the animal or on a covering, must not
assume a position as if he sat upon one of those seats which
people use in <span class="locked">carriages<a name="FNanchor_1330" id="FNanchor_1330" href="#Footnote_1330" class="fnanchor">1330</a></span>.</p>

<p>Our saddles at present consist of a wooden frame called the
saddle-tree, which has on the fore part the pommel; behind it
the crupper; and at the sides the stirrups. In the inside they
are stuffed like a cushion, and on the outside are covered with
leather or cloth. They are made fast to the horse by means
of a girth which goes round the animal’s belly; and the breast-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">433</a></span>leather
and crupper prevent them from being moved either
forwards or backwards. It is extremely probable that they
were invented in the middle of the fourth century: but it is
hardly possible to find any certain proof; for we have reason
to believe that the ancient covering was gradually transformed
into a saddle. <span class="locked">Pancirollus<a name="FNanchor_1331" id="FNanchor_1331" href="#Footnote_1331" class="fnanchor">1331</a></span> thinks that the first mention of
a saddle is to be found in Zonaras; and many have adopted
his opinion. This historian relates that Constantine the
younger was killed in the year 340 when he fell from his
saddle. But in this proof alone I place very little confidence;
and Pancirollus seems to have founded his assertion on the
Latin translation, in which the word <i>sella</i> is used. Both the
Greek and Latin <span class="locked">terms<a name="FNanchor_1332" id="FNanchor_1332" href="#Footnote_1332" class="fnanchor">1332</a></span>, it is true, were employed at later
periods to signify a proper saddle; but the Greek word was
used long before for the back of the horse, or the place where
the rider sat; and the words of Zonaras may be so understood
as if Constantine was killed after he had fallen from his <span class="locked">horse<a name="FNanchor_1333" id="FNanchor_1333" href="#Footnote_1333" class="fnanchor">1333</a></span>.</p>

<p>Montfaucon<a name="FNanchor_1334" id="FNanchor_1334" href="#Footnote_1334" class="fnanchor">1334</a> has given a figure of the pillar of Theodosius
the Great, on which he thinks he can distinguish a saddle;
and indeed, if the engraving be correct, it must be allowed
that the covering of the horse on which the rider sits seems,
in the fore part, to resemble the pommel, and behind the extremity
of the saddle-tree of our common saddles.</p>

<p>The clearest proof of the antiquity of saddles is the order
of the emperor Theodosius in the year 385, by which those who
wished to ride post-horses were forbidden to use saddles that
weighed more than sixty pounds. If a saddle was heavier, it
was to be cut to <span class="locked">pieces<a name="FNanchor_1335" id="FNanchor_1335" href="#Footnote_1335" class="fnanchor">1335</a></span>. This passage appears certainly to
allude to a proper saddle, which at that period, soon after its
invention, must have been extremely heavy; and we may conclude
from it also, that every traveller had one of his own.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">434</a></span>
As the saddle is here called <i>sella</i>, and as that word occurs
oftener at this than at any other period, for the seat of the
rider, it is probable that it is to be understood afterwards as
signifying a real saddle. Besides, it cannot be denied that
where it is used, many other little circumstances are found
which may with great propriety be applied to our saddles.</p>

<p>Nazarius, in his panegyric on Constantine the Great, describing
the manner in which the enemy’s cavalry were
destroyed, says that, when almost lifeless, they hung <i>sedilibus</i>.
Lipsius is of opinion that they could have hung in this manner
only by saddles; but there is reason to think that they might
lay hold of the coverings of the horses, if it be certain that
these were girded to the animals like our saddles. Of this,
however, there is no proof; for though some have asserted
that <i>postilena</i> signified a girth, that meaning has not been
supported by sufficient authorities; and it is more probable that
the words <i>postilena</i>, <i>antilena</i>, and also <i>postella</i> and <i>antella</i>,
as well as the girth itself, which they are supposed to express,
were not introduced till after the invention of saddles. The
first word occurs in <span class="locked">Plautus<a name="FNanchor_1336" id="FNanchor_1336" href="#Footnote_1336" class="fnanchor">1336</a></span>; but it perhaps alludes to some
part of the harness of draught-horses or cattle. <span class="locked">Vegetius<a name="FNanchor_1337" id="FNanchor_1337" href="#Footnote_1337" class="fnanchor">1337</a></span>
distinguishes saddle-horses from others; and the saddle-tree
seems to be mentioned by Sidonius <span class="locked">Apollinaris<a name="FNanchor_1338" id="FNanchor_1338" href="#Footnote_1338" class="fnanchor">1338</a></span>. In the fifth
century saddles were made so extravagantly magnificent, that
a prohibition was issued by the emperor Leo I. in which it
was ordered that no one should ornament them with pearls or
precious <span class="locked">stones<a name="FNanchor_1339" id="FNanchor_1339" href="#Footnote_1339" class="fnanchor">1339</a></span>. In the sixth century, the emperor Mauritius
required that the saddles of the cavalry should have large
coverings of <span class="locked">fur<a name="FNanchor_1340" id="FNanchor_1340" href="#Footnote_1340" class="fnanchor">1340</a></span>. Further information respecting saddles in
later times may be seen in Du Cange, who has collected also
various terms of art to which the invention of saddles gave
rise, such as <i>sellatores</i>, saddlers, of which the French have made
<i>selliers</i>; <i>sellare</i>, the saddle-tree; <i>sellare</i> and <i>insellare</i>, to saddle.
The ignominious punishment of bearing the saddle, of which
a good account may be found in Du <span class="locked">Cange<a name="FNanchor_1341" id="FNanchor_1341" href="#Footnote_1341" class="fnanchor">1341</a></span>, had its origin
in the middle ages. The conjecture of Goropius <span class="locked">Becanus<a name="FNanchor_1342" id="FNanchor_1342" href="#Footnote_1342" class="fnanchor">1342</a></span>,
that the saddle was invented by the <i>Salii</i>, and named after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">435</a></span>
them, is not worth refutation; as it is perfectly clear that the
denomination of <i>sella</i> arose from the likeness of a saddle to a
chair; and by way of distinction Sidonius and the emperor
Leo say <i>sella equestris</i>; and Jornandes says <i>sella equitatoria</i>.
Others, perhaps, will pass no better judgement on a conjecture
which I shall here venture to give. I consider it as probable that
the invention of saddles belongs to the Persians; because, according
to the testimony of Xenophon, they first began to
render the seat of the rider more convenient and easy, by
placing more covering on the backs of their horses than was
usual in other countries. Besides, the horses of Persia were
first made choice of in preference for saddle-horses, on account,
perhaps, of their being early trained to bear a saddle, though
<span class="locked">Vegetius<a name="FNanchor_1343" id="FNanchor_1343" href="#Footnote_1343" class="fnanchor">1343</a></span> assigns a different reason.</p>

Le Beau, in l’Académie des Inscriptions, vol. xxxix. p. 333, forms the same

to produce their horses without any covering, that it might be more easily
seen whether they were in good condition. This useful regulation was
abolished by Nero, in order that the cavalry might exhibit a grander appearance.

<h2 id="stirrups">STIRRUPS.</h2>

<p>Respecting the antiquity of stirrups several men of <span class="locked">learning<a name="FNanchor_1344" id="FNanchor_1344" href="#Footnote_1344" class="fnanchor">1344</a></span>
have long ago made researches; but as their observations are
scattered through a great variety of books, some of which are
now scarce, and are mingled with much falsehood, it will perhaps
afford pleasure to many to find here collected and reduced
into order the greater, or at least the most important,
part of them. In executing this task I shall aim at more than
the character of a diligent collector; for to bring together
information of this kind, to arrange it, and to make it useful,
requires no less readiness of thought than the labours of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">436</a></span>
who assume the character of original thinkers, and who imagine
that they render others inferior to themselves when they
bestow on them the appellation of compilers.</p>

<p>We have here a new proof how much people may be deceived,
when they suppose that objects must be of great antiquity
because they tend to common convenience and because
they appear even so indispensably necessary and easy to have
been invented, that one can scarcely conceive how they could
at any time have been wanting. I cannot, however, deprive
our ancestors of the merit of ingenuity and invention; for they
must undoubtedly have possessed no small share of talents and
ability, to perform, without the assistance of our arts, what
perhaps would be difficult even for the present age to accomplish.
And who knows but there are many things still to be
invented, the discovery of which may give posterity equal reason
to reproach us?</p>

<p>Stirrups are useful in two points of view; for they not only
assist one in mounting, but also in riding, as they support the
legs of the rider, which otherwise would be exposed to much
inconvenience. No traces of any invention for this purpose
are to be found in the old Greek and Latin writers; and
though means to assist people to get on horseback were devised
in the course of time, neither stirrups nor any permanent
support to the legs were for a long period thought of. Nothing
that could perform the same service as a stirrup is to be
perceived on ancient coins which exhibit the representation of
persons on horseback; on statues cast or formed with the
chisel, or on any remains of ancient sculpture. In the excellent
equestrian statues of Trajan and Antoninus, the legs of the
rider hang down without any support whatever. Had stirrups
been in use when these statues were formed, the artists certainly
would not have omitted them; and the case would have
been the same with those writers who speak so fully of riding,
and of the necessary equipage and furniture. How is it possible,
that Xenophon, in the two books which he wrote expressly
on horsemanship and the art of riding, where he gives
rules for mounting, and where he points out means for assisting
old people and infirm persons, should not have mentioned
stirrups had he been acquainted with them? And how could
they have been passed over by Julius Pollux, in his Lexicon,
where he gives every expression that concerns riding-furniture?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">437</a></span>
<span class="locked">Hippocrates<a name="FNanchor_1345" id="FNanchor_1345" href="#Footnote_1345" class="fnanchor">1345</a></span> and <span class="locked">Galen<a name="FNanchor_1346" id="FNanchor_1346" href="#Footnote_1346" class="fnanchor">1346</a></span> speak of a disease which in their
time was occasioned by long and frequent riding, because the
legs hung down without any support. <span class="locked">Suetonius<a name="FNanchor_1347" id="FNanchor_1347" href="#Footnote_1347" class="fnanchor">1347</a></span> also relates
that Germanicus, the father of Caligula, by riding often after
dinner endeavoured to strengthen his ankles, which had become
weak; and Magius explains this very properly by telling us,
that as his legs hung down without stirrups, they would be
continually moved backwards and forwards, and of course
the circulation of the blood towards those parts would be increased.</p>

<p>Neither in the Greek nor Roman authors do we meet with
any term that can be applied to stirrups, for <i>staffa</i>, <i>stapia</i>,
<i>staphium</i>, <i>stapha</i>, <i>stapedium</i>, <i>stapeda</i>, and <i>stapes</i> are words
formed in modern times. The last, as Vossius and others say,
was invented by Franc. Philelphus, who was born in 1398 and
died in <span class="locked">1481<a name="FNanchor_1348" id="FNanchor_1348" href="#Footnote_1348" class="fnanchor">1348</a></span>, to express properly a thing unknown to the
ancients, and for which they could have no name. The other
words are older, as may be seen in Du Cange, and appear to
be derived from the German <i>stapf</i>, which is still retained in
<i>Fuss-stapf</i>, a foot-step.</p>

<p>The name of one of the ear-bones, which, on account of its
likeness to a stirrup, has from anatomists received the same
appellation, may occur here to some of my readers; and if
that expression was known to the ancients, it might invalidate
my assertion. That small bone, however, was first remarked
at Naples in the year 1546 by John Philip Ingrassias, a Sicilian,
who called it <i>stapes</i>. To the ancient anatomists it was
not <span class="locked">known<a name="FNanchor_1349" id="FNanchor_1349" href="#Footnote_1349" class="fnanchor">1349</a></span>.</p>

<p>Montfaucon is of opinion that it is impossible there could
be stirrups before saddles were invented, because the former,
at present, are fastened to the latter. This conclusion, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">438</a></span>
is not altogether just. Stirrups might have been suspended
from leather straps girt round the horse. In mounting,
it would only have been necessary that some one should hold
fast the strap on the other side; and stirrups arranged in this
manner would have supported the feet of the rider as well as
ours. It is certain that mounting on horseback was formerly
much easier than it has been since the invention of high saddles;
and it is probable that stirrups were introduced soon
after that period. The arguments which I have here adduced
will receive additional force when one considers the inconvenient
means which the ancients employed to assist them in
getting on horseback; and which, undoubtedly, they would
not have used had they been acquainted with stirrups.</p>

<p>The Roman manners required that young men and expert
riders should be able to vault on horseback without any assistance.
To accustom them to this agility there were wooden
horses in the Campus Martius, on which practitioners were
obliged to learn to mount and dismount, both on the right
and the left side, at first unarmed, and afterwards with arms
in their <span class="locked">hands<a name="FNanchor_1350" id="FNanchor_1350" href="#Footnote_1350" class="fnanchor">1350</a></span>. In many public places, particularly highways,
stones were erected, to which a rider could lead his horse
in order to mount with more facility. Such stones Gracchus
caused to be set <span class="locked">up<a name="FNanchor_1351" id="FNanchor_1351" href="#Footnote_1351" class="fnanchor">1351</a></span>; and they were to be found at many
cities, in the sixteenth century, especially near the council-houses,
that they might be used by the members of the council,
who at that time did not ride in coaches. A convenience
of this kind was constructed at the Roman gate at Frankfort
in 1502; and steps for the same purpose may be still seen in
many parts of England, where they are employed principally
by the ladies. If a certain ludicrous inscription be ancient,
such a stone was called <i>suppedaneum</i>; but this word occurs
nowhere <span class="locked">else<a name="FNanchor_1352" id="FNanchor_1352" href="#Footnote_1352" class="fnanchor">1352</a></span>.</p>

<p>People of high rank and fortune kept riding-servants to assist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">439</a></span>
them in mounting, who were called <i>stratores</i><a name="FNanchor_1353" id="FNanchor_1353" href="#Footnote_1353" class="fnanchor">1353</a>. It was
usual also to have portable stools, which were placed close to
the horse when one wished to mount; and this gave rise to
the barbarous practice of making conquered princes and generals
stoop down that the victor might more easily get on
horseback by stepping upon their backs as upon a stool. In
this ignominious manner was the emperor Valerian treated by
Sapor, king of <span class="locked">Persia<a name="FNanchor_1354" id="FNanchor_1354" href="#Footnote_1354" class="fnanchor">1354</a></span>. Some horses also were so instructed
that they kneeled until the rider <span class="locked">mounted<a name="FNanchor_1355" id="FNanchor_1355" href="#Footnote_1355" class="fnanchor">1355</a></span>; and warriors had on
their spears or lances a step or projection, on which they could
rest the foot while they got on <span class="locked">horseback<a name="FNanchor_1356" id="FNanchor_1356" href="#Footnote_1356" class="fnanchor">1356</a></span>. Winkelmann has
described a cut stone in the collection of Baron Stosch, on
which a rider is represented in the act of mounting with one
foot on the step of his spear; and it appears, by an ancient
drawing, that a leather <span class="locked">loop<a name="FNanchor_1357" id="FNanchor_1357" href="#Footnote_1357" class="fnanchor">1357</a></span>, into which the foot could be
put, was fastened sometimes to the lance also.</p>

<p>Of those who believe that traces of stirrups are to be found
among the ancients, no one has erred more than Galeotus
<span class="locked">Martius<a name="FNanchor_1358" id="FNanchor_1358" href="#Footnote_1358" class="fnanchor">1358</a></span>, who follows a wrong reading in <span class="locked">Lucretius<a name="FNanchor_1359" id="FNanchor_1359" href="#Footnote_1359" class="fnanchor">1359</a></span>, and
translates still worse the words which he adopts. Magius and
others consider as authentic an inscription, in which stirrups
are clearly mentioned; and because the letters D. M. (<i>diis
manibus</i>), usual in Pagan inscriptions, appear at the top, he
places it in the first century of the Christian æra<a name="FNanchor_1360" id="FNanchor_1360" href="#Footnote_1360" class="fnanchor">1360</a>. <span class="locked">Menage<a name="FNanchor_1361" id="FNanchor_1361" href="#Footnote_1361" class="fnanchor">1361</a></span>,
however, and others have already remarked that this inscription
was forged in modern times, and in all probability by
Franc. Columna, who lived in the middle of the sixteenth
century, and who sometimes called himself <span class="locked">Polyphilus<a name="FNanchor_1362" id="FNanchor_1362" href="#Footnote_1362" class="fnanchor">1362</a></span>. Gruter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">440</a></span>
therefore, reckons it among those which ought to be rejected
as spurious: and of as little authority is the silver coin
on which the Emperor Constantine is represented on horseback
with stirrups.</p>

<p>Magius quotes from the letters of Jerome, who died in the
year 420, the following words, “Se cum quasdam accepit litteras
jumentum conscensurum, jam pedem habuisse in bistapia.”
These words have been again quoted by several writers; and
we may readily believe that the author when he wrote them
alluded to a stirrup. Magius however quotes from memory,
and says, “Si memoria non labat.” But these words are not
to be found in Jerome; and it is probable that Magius may
have read them in the works of some other author.</p>

<p>The first certain account of stirrups, as far as I have been
able to learn, is in a book by <span class="locked">Mauritius<a name="FNanchor_1363" id="FNanchor_1363" href="#Footnote_1363" class="fnanchor">1363</a></span> respecting the art of
war, where the author says that a horseman must have at his
saddle two iron <i>scalæ</i>. This work, commonly ascribed to the
emperor Mauritius, is supposed to have been written in the
end of the sixth century; and it is not a sufficient proof to
the contrary, that mention is made in it of the Turks, Franks,
and Lombards. The first were then well known; for Justin II.
some time before had concluded a peace with them: the Lombards
made themselves known in the middle of that century:
and the Franks had been known much longer. The same
words are inserted by the emperor Leo VI., in his work on
tactics, which he wrote in the end of the ninth <span class="locked">century<a name="FNanchor_1364" id="FNanchor_1364" href="#Footnote_1364" class="fnanchor">1364</a></span>. Still
clearer is another passage of <span class="locked">Mauritius<a name="FNanchor_1365" id="FNanchor_1365" href="#Footnote_1365" class="fnanchor">1365</a></span>, and of the emperor
<span class="locked">Leo<a name="FNanchor_1366" id="FNanchor_1366" href="#Footnote_1366" class="fnanchor">1366</a></span>, where it is expressly said, that the <i>deputati</i>, who were
obliged to carry the wounded horsemen from the field, ought
to have two stirrups on the left side of the horse, one at the
fore-part and the other at the hind-part of the saddle-tree,
that they might each take a disabled soldier on horseback behind
them. That these <i>scalæ</i> were real stirrups there seems
to be no reason to doubt; and in my opinion, that word, and
other expressions of the like kind to be found in later writers,
may be understood in this sense, especially as concomitant
circumstances appear rather to strengthen than to oppose such
a conjecture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">441</a></span>
Isidore, in the seventh century, says “Scansuæ, ferrum per
quod equus scanditur;” and also “Astraba, tabella, in qua pedes
<span class="locked">requiescunt<a name="FNanchor_1367" id="FNanchor_1367" href="#Footnote_1367" class="fnanchor">1367</a></span>:” both which expressions allude to stirrups. Leo
the Grammarian, in the beginning of the tenth <span class="locked">century<a name="FNanchor_1368" id="FNanchor_1368" href="#Footnote_1368" class="fnanchor">1368</a></span>, calls
them, as Mauritius does, <i>scalæ</i>. Suidas, who wrote about the
same period, says <i>anaboleus</i> signifies not only a riding-servant,
who assists one in mounting, but also what by the Romans was
called <i>scala</i>. As the machine used for pulling off boots is
named a Jack, because it performs the office of a boy, in the
like manner that appellation, which at first belonged to the
riding-servant, was afterwards given to stirrups, because they
answered the same purpose. Suidas, as a proof of the latter
meaning, quotes a passage from an anonymous writer, who
says that Massias, even when an old man, could vault on horseback
without the assistance of a stirrup (<i>anaboleus</i>). Lipsius
thinks that the passage is to be found in <span class="locked">Appian<a name="FNanchor_1369" id="FNanchor_1369" href="#Footnote_1369" class="fnanchor">1369</a></span>, respecting
Masanissa; and in that case the first meaning of the word may
be adopted. Suidas, according to every appearance, would
have been in a mistake, had he given Masanissa at so early a
period the Roman <i>scalæ</i>, with which he could not be acquainted.
But that the passage is from Appian, and that Masanissa ought
to be read instead of Massias, is only mere conjecture; at any
rate Suidas could commit no mistake in saying that the Romans
in his time made use of <i>scalæ</i>. Lipsius, however, was
not altogether wrong in considering this quotation alone as an
insufficient proof of stirrups, because with the still older and
more express testimony of Mauritius he was unacquainted.
Eustathius, the commentator of <span class="locked">Homer<a name="FNanchor_1370" id="FNanchor_1370" href="#Footnote_1370" class="fnanchor">1370</a></span>, speaks in a much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">442</a></span>
clearer manner; but he gives us to understand that stirrups
in his time, that is in the twelfth century, had not become
very common. On a piece of tapestry of the eleventh century,
which Montfaucon caused to be <span class="locked">engraven<a name="FNanchor_1371" id="FNanchor_1371" href="#Footnote_1371" class="fnanchor">1371</a></span>, the saddles
of all the horses appear to have stirrups. Aimonius calls them
<i>scandilia</i><a name="FNanchor_1372" id="FNanchor_1372" href="#Footnote_1372" class="fnanchor">1372</a>, and in the twelfth century the word <i>staffa</i> occurs
very often, and without doubt in that <span class="locked">sense<a name="FNanchor_1373" id="FNanchor_1373" href="#Footnote_1373" class="fnanchor">1373</a></span>. In the ages of
superstition, the clergy carried their boundless pride to such a
length, that they caused emperors and kings to hold their
stirrups when they mounted on <span class="locked">horseback<a name="FNanchor_1374" id="FNanchor_1374" href="#Footnote_1374" class="fnanchor">1374</a></span>. It however long
continued to be thought a mark of superior dexterity to ride
without stirrups, at least Phile praises Cantacuzenus on this
<span class="locked">account<a name="FNanchor_1375" id="FNanchor_1375" href="#Footnote_1375" class="fnanchor">1375</a></span>.</p>

<h2 id="horse">HORSE-SHOES.</h2>

<p>It can be proved by incontestable evidence, that the ancient
Greeks and Romans endeavoured, by means of some covering,
to secure from injury the hoofs of their horses and other animals
of burden; but it is equally certain that our usual shoes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">443</a></span>
which are nailed on, were invented much <span class="locked">later<a name="FNanchor_1376" id="FNanchor_1376" href="#Footnote_1376" class="fnanchor">1376</a></span>. We are told
by <span class="locked">Aristotle<a name="FNanchor_1377" id="FNanchor_1377" href="#Footnote_1377" class="fnanchor">1377</a></span> and <span class="locked">Pliny<a name="FNanchor_1378" id="FNanchor_1378" href="#Footnote_1378" class="fnanchor">1378</a></span>, that shoes were put upon camels in
the time of war, and during long journeys; and the former
gives them the same name as that given to the shoes, or rather
socks or soles, of the common people, which were made of
strong ox-leather. When the hoofs of cattle, particularly
oxen, had sustained any hurt, they were furnished with shoes,
made of some plant of the hemp <span class="locked">kind<a name="FNanchor_1379" id="FNanchor_1379" href="#Footnote_1379" class="fnanchor">1379</a></span>, wove or plaited <span class="locked">together<a name="FNanchor_1380" id="FNanchor_1380" href="#Footnote_1380" class="fnanchor">1380</a></span>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">444</a></span>
These indeed were only a sort of chirurgical bandages;
but such shoes were given in particular to mules, which
in ancient times were employed more than at present for
riding; and it appears by two instances of immoderate extravagance
handed down to us by Roman writers, that people of
rank caused these shoes to be made very costly. Nero, when
he undertook short journeys, was drawn always by mules which
had silver <span class="locked">shoes<a name="FNanchor_1381" id="FNanchor_1381" href="#Footnote_1381" class="fnanchor">1381</a></span>; and those of his wife Poppæa had shoes of
<span class="locked">gold<a name="FNanchor_1382" id="FNanchor_1382" href="#Footnote_1382" class="fnanchor">1382</a></span>. The information of these authors however is not sufficient
to enable us to conjecture how these shoes were made;
but from a passage of Dio Cassius we have reason to think
that the upper part only was formed of those noble metals, or
that they were perhaps plaited out of thin <span class="locked">slips<a name="FNanchor_1383" id="FNanchor_1383" href="#Footnote_1383" class="fnanchor">1383</a></span>.</p>

<p>Arrian also reckons these soles or shoes among the riding-furniture
of an <span class="locked">ass<a name="FNanchor_1384" id="FNanchor_1384" href="#Footnote_1384" class="fnanchor">1384</a></span>. Xenophon relates that certain people of
Asia were accustomed, when the snow lay deep on the ground,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">445</a></span>
to draw socks over the feet of their horses, as they would
otherwise, he adds, have sunk up to the bellies in the <span class="locked">snow<a name="FNanchor_1385" id="FNanchor_1385" href="#Footnote_1385" class="fnanchor">1385</a></span>.
I cannot comprehend how their sinking among the snow could,
by such means, have been prevented; and I am inclined rather
to believe, that their feet were covered in that manner in order
to save them from being wounded. The Russians, in some
parts, such as Kamtschatka, employ the same method in regard
to the dogs which draw their sledges, or catch seals on
the ice. They are furnished with shoes which are bound
round their feet, and which are so ingeniously made that their
claws project through small <span class="locked">holes<a name="FNanchor_1386" id="FNanchor_1386" href="#Footnote_1386" class="fnanchor">1386</a></span>.</p>

<p>The shoes of the Roman cattle must have been very ill
fastened, as they were so readily lost in stiff <span class="locked">clay<a name="FNanchor_1387" id="FNanchor_1387" href="#Footnote_1387" class="fnanchor">1387</a></span>; and it
appears that they were not used during a whole journey, but
were put on either in miry places, or at times when pomp or
the safety of the cattle required it; for we are informed by
Suetonius, that the coachman of Vespasian once stopped on
the road to put on the shoes of his <span class="locked">mules<a name="FNanchor_1388" id="FNanchor_1388" href="#Footnote_1388" class="fnanchor">1388</a></span>.</p>

<p>The reason why mention of these shoes on horses occurs so
seldom, undoubtedly is, because, at the time when the before-quoted
authors wrote, mules and asses were more employed
than horses, as has been already remarked by Scheffer and
others. Artemidorus speaks of a shod horse, and makes use
of the same expression employed in regard to other <span class="locked">cattle<a name="FNanchor_1389" id="FNanchor_1389" href="#Footnote_1389" class="fnanchor">1389</a></span>.
Winkelmann has described a cut stone in the collection of
Baron <span class="locked">Stosch<a name="FNanchor_1390" id="FNanchor_1390" href="#Footnote_1390" class="fnanchor">1390</a></span>, on which is represented the figure of a man
holding up one foot of a horse, while another, kneeling, is employed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">446</a></span>
in fastening on a shoe. These are all the proofs of
horses being shod among the ancients with which I am acquainted.
That they were never shod in war, or at any rate,
that these socks were not sufficient to defend the hoof from
injury, seems evident from the testimony of various authors.
When Mithridates was besieging Cyzicus, he was obliged to
send his cavalry to Bithynia, because the hoofs of the horses
were entirely spoiled and worn <span class="locked">out<a name="FNanchor_1391" id="FNanchor_1391" href="#Footnote_1391" class="fnanchor">1391</a></span>. In the Latin translation
it is added that this was occasioned by the horses not having
shoes; but there are no such words in the original, which
seems rather to afford a strong proof that in the army of Mithridates
there was nothing of the kind. The case seems to
have been the same in the army of Alexander; for we are
told by Diodorus Siculus, that with uninterrupted marching
the hoofs of his horses were totally broken and <span class="locked">destroyed<a name="FNanchor_1392" id="FNanchor_1392" href="#Footnote_1392" class="fnanchor">1392</a></span>.
An instance of the like kind is to be found in Cinnamus, where
the cavalry were obliged to be left behind, as they had suffered
considerably in the hoofs; an evil, says the historian, to which
horses are often <span class="locked">liable<a name="FNanchor_1393" id="FNanchor_1393" href="#Footnote_1393" class="fnanchor">1393</a></span>.</p>

<p>From what has been said I think I may venture to draw
this conclusion, that the ancient Greek and Roman cavalry
had not always, or in common, a covering for the hoofs of
their horses, and that they were not acquainted with shoes
like those used at present, which are nailed on. In the remains
of ancient sculpture, among the ruins of <span class="locked">Persepolis<a name="FNanchor_1394" id="FNanchor_1394" href="#Footnote_1394" class="fnanchor">1394</a></span>,
on Trajan’s pillar, those of Antoninus, Marcus Aurelius, and
many others, no representation of them is to be found; and
one can never suppose that the artists designedly omitted them,
as they have imitated with the utmost minuteness the shoes of
the soldiers, and the nails which fasten on the iron that surrounds
the wheels of carriages. The objection that the artists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">447</a></span>
have not represented the shoes then in use, and that for the
same reason they might have omitted shoes such as ours though
common, is of no weight; for the former were used only very
seldom; they were not given to every horse, and when they
were drawn over the hoof and made fast, they had an awkward
appearance, which would not have been the case with iron
shoes like those of the moderns. A basso-relievo, it is true,
may still be seen in the Mattei palace at Rome, on which is
represented a hunting-match of Gallienus, and where one of
the horses has a real iron shoe on one of his feet. From this
circumstance <span class="locked">Fabretti<a name="FNanchor_1395" id="FNanchor_1395" href="#Footnote_1395" class="fnanchor">1395</a></span> infers that the use of horse-shoes is of
the same antiquity as that piece of sculpture; but Winkelmann
has remarked, that this foot is not ancient, and that it
has been added by a modern <span class="locked">artist<a name="FNanchor_1396" id="FNanchor_1396" href="#Footnote_1396" class="fnanchor">1396</a></span>.</p>

<p>I will readily allow that proofs drawn from an object not
being mentioned in the writings of the ancients are of no
great importance, and that they may be even very often false.
I am however of opinion, whatever may be said to the contrary,
that Polybius, Xenophon in his book on riding and
horsemanship, Julius Pollux in his Dictionary where he mentions
fully everything that relates to horse-furniture and riding-equipage,
and the authors who treat on husbandry and the
veterinary art, could not possibly have omitted to take notice
of horse-shoes, had they been known at those periods when
they wrote. Can we suppose that writers would be silent respecting
the shoeing of horses, had it been practised, when
they speak so circumstantially of the breeding and rearing of
these animals, and prescribe remedies for the diseases and accidents
to which they are liable? On account of the danger
which arises from horses being badly shod, the treatment of
all those disorders to which they are incident has been committed
to farriers; and is it in the least probable that this part
of their employment should have been entirely forgotten by
Vegetius and the rest of the ancients, who studied the nature
and maladies of cattle? They indeed speak seldom, and not
very expressly, of the ancient shoes put on horses; but this is
not to be wondered at, as they had little occasion to mention
them, because they gave rise to no particular infirmity. Where
they could be of utility, they have recommended them, which
plainly shows that the use of them was not then common.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">448</a></span>
Gesner remarks very properly, that Lycinus, in Lucian, who
was unacquainted with riding, when enumerating the many
dangers to which he might be exposed by mounting on horseback,
speaks only of being trod under the feet of the cavalry,
without making any mention of the injury to be apprehended
from iron shoes. To be sensible, however, of the full force of
this argument, one must read the whole <span class="locked">passage<a name="FNanchor_1397" id="FNanchor_1397" href="#Footnote_1397" class="fnanchor">1397</a></span>. Many of
the ancient historians also, when they speak of armies, give an
account of all those persons who were most necessary in them,
and of the duties which they performed; but farriers are not
even mentioned. When it was necessary for the horses to
have shoes, each rider put them upon his own; no persons in
particular were requisite for that service; but had shoes, such
as those of the moderns, been then in use, the assistance of
farriers would have been indispensable.</p>

<p>As our horse-shoes were unknown to the ancients, they employed
the utmost care to procure horses with strong <span class="locked">hoofs<a name="FNanchor_1398" id="FNanchor_1398" href="#Footnote_1398" class="fnanchor">1398</a></span>,
and for the same reason they tried every method possible to
harden the hoofs and to render them more durable. Precepts
for this purpose may be found in <span class="locked">Xenophon<a name="FNanchor_1399" id="FNanchor_1399" href="#Footnote_1399" class="fnanchor">1399</a></span>, <span class="locked">Vegetius<a name="FNanchor_1400" id="FNanchor_1400" href="#Footnote_1400" class="fnanchor">1400</a></span>, and
other authors. It indeed appears wonderful to us, that the
use of iron shoes should have remained so long unknown; but
it was certainly a bold attempt to nail a piece of iron, for the
first time, under the foot of a horse; and I firmly believe that
there are many persons at present, who, had they never seen
such a thing, would doubt the possibility of it if they heard it
mentioned. Horse-shoes, however, are not absolutely necessary;
horses in many countries are scarce, and in some they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">449</a></span>
are not shod even at present. This is still the case in Ethiopia,
in Japan, and in <span class="locked">Tartary<a name="FNanchor_1401" id="FNanchor_1401" href="#Footnote_1401" class="fnanchor">1401</a></span>. In Japan, shoes, such as those
of the ancients, are used. Iron shoes are less necessary in
places where the ground is soft and free from stones; and it
appears to me very probable, that the practice of shoeing became
more common as the paving of streets was increased.
There were paved highways indeed at a very early period, but
they were a long time scarce, and were to be found only in
opulent countries. But when roads covered with gravel were
almost everywhere constructed, the hoofs of the horses would
have soon been destroyed without iron shoes, and the preservatives
before employed would have been of very little
service.</p>

<p>However strong I consider these proofs, which show that
the ancients did not give their horses shoes such as ours, I
think it my duty to mention and examine those grounds from
which men of learning and ingenuity have affirmed the contrary.
Vossius lays great stress, in particular, upon a passage
of Xenophon, who, as he thinks, recommends the preservation
of the hoofs by means of iron. Gesner, however, has explained
the words used by that author so clearly as to leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">450</a></span>
no doubt that Vossius judged too rashly. <span class="locked">Xenophon<a name="FNanchor_1402" id="FNanchor_1402" href="#Footnote_1402" class="fnanchor">1402</a></span> only
gives directions to harden the hoofs of a horse, and to make
them stronger and more durable; which is to be done, he
says, by causing him to walk and to stamp with his feet in a
place covered with stones. He describes the stones proper
for this purpose; and that they may be retained in their position,
he advises that they should be bound down with cramps
of iron. The word which Vossius refers to the hoofs, alludes
without doubt to the stones which were to be kept together
by the above means. Xenophon, in another work, repeats
the same <span class="locked">advice<a name="FNanchor_1403" id="FNanchor_1403" href="#Footnote_1403" class="fnanchor">1403</a></span>, and says that experience will soon show
how much the hoofs will be strengthened by this operation.</p>

<p>Vossius considers also as an argument in his favour the expressions
used by Homer and other poets when they speak of
iron-footed and brazen-footed horses, loud-sounding hoofs, &amp;c.,
and is of opinion that such epithets could be applied only to
horses that had iron shoes. But if we recollect that hard and
strong hoofs were among the properties of a good horse, we
shall find that these expressions are perfectly intelligible without
calling in the assistance of modern horse-shoes. Xenophon
employs the like comparisons free from poetical ornament,
and explains them in a manner sufficiently clear. The hoofs,
says he, must be so hard, that when the horse strikes the
ground, they may resound like a cymbal. Eustathius, the
scholiast of Aristophanes, and Hesychius, have also explained
these expressions as alluding to the hardness and solidity of
the hoofs. Of the same kind is the <i>equus sonipes</i> of the Roman
<span class="locked">poet<a name="FNanchor_1404" id="FNanchor_1404" href="#Footnote_1404" class="fnanchor">1404</a></span>; and the stags and oxen with metal <span class="locked">feet<a name="FNanchor_1405" id="FNanchor_1405" href="#Footnote_1405" class="fnanchor">1405</a></span>, mentioned
in fabulous history, which undoubtedly were not shod.
Epithets of the like nature were applied by the poets to persons
who had a strong <span class="locked">voice<a name="FNanchor_1406" id="FNanchor_1406" href="#Footnote_1406" class="fnanchor">1406</a></span>.</p>

<p>Le Beau quotes a passage of Tryphiodorus, which on the
first view seems to allude to a real horse-shoe. This author,
where he speaks of the construction of the Trojan horse, says
that the artist did not forget the metal or iron on the <span class="locked">hoofs<a name="FNanchor_1407" id="FNanchor_1407" href="#Footnote_1407" class="fnanchor">1407</a></span>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">451</a></span>
But supposing it true that the author here meant real shoes,
this would be no proof of their being known at the time of
the Trojan war, and we could only be authorised to allow them
the same antiquity as the period when the poet wrote. That
however is not known. According to the most probable conjectures,
it was between the reign of Severus and that of
Anastasius, or between the beginning of the third and the sixth
century. Besides, the whole account may be understood as
alluding to the ancient shoes. At any rate, it ought to be
explained in this manner till it be proved by undisputed authorities
that shoes, such as those of the moderns, were used
in the time of the above poet.</p>

<p>Vossius asserts that he had in his possession a Greek manuscript
on the veterinary art, in which there were some figures,
where the nails under the feet of the horses could be plainly
distinguished. But we are ignorant whether the manuscript
or the figures still exist, nor is the antiquity of either of them
known. It is probable that shoes were given to the horses by
a modern transcriber, in the same manner as another put a
pen into the hand of Aristotle.</p>

<p>In my opinion we must expect to meet with the first certain
information respecting horse-shoes in much later writers than
those in which it has been hitherto sought for, and supposed
to have been discovered. Were it properly ascertained that
the piece of iron found in the grave of Childeric was really
a part of a horse-shoe, I should consider it as affording the
first information on this subject, and should place the use of
modern horse-shoes in the eighth century. But I do not think
that the certainty of its being so is established in a manner so
complete as has hitherto been believed. Those who affirm
that this piece of iron had exactly the shape of a modern
horse-shoe, judged only from an engraving, and did not perceive
that the figure was <span class="locked">enlarged<a name="FNanchor_1408" id="FNanchor_1408" href="#Footnote_1408" class="fnanchor">1408</a></span>. The piece of iron itself,
which seemed to have four holes on each side, was so consumed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">452</a></span>
with rust, that it broke while an attempt was made to
clear them; and undoubtedly it could not be so perfect as the
engraving.</p>

<p>The account given by Pancirollus induced me to hope that
I should find in Nicetas undoubted evidence of horse-shoes
being used about the beginning of the thirteenth century;
but that writer has deceived both himself and his readers, by
confining himself to the translation. After the death of Henry
Baldwin, the Latins threw down a beautiful equestrian statue
of brass, which some believed to be that of Joshua. When
the feet of the horse were carried away, an image was found
under one of them which represented a Bulgarian, and not a
Latin as had been before supposed. Such is the account of
Nicetas; but Pancirollus misrepresents it entirely; for he says
that the image was found under a piece of iron torn off from
one of the feet of the horse, and which he considers therefore
as a horse-shoe. The image, however, appears to have represented
a vanquished enemy, and to have been placed in an
abject posture under the feet of the statue (a piece of flattery
which artists still employ), and to have been so situated that
it could not be distinctly seen till the whole statue was broken
to pieces. Hence perhaps arose the vengeance of the Latins
against the statue, because that small figure was by some supposed
to represent one of their <span class="locked">nation<a name="FNanchor_1409" id="FNanchor_1409" href="#Footnote_1409" class="fnanchor">1409</a></span>.</p>

<p>As it appeared to me that the words used by ancient authors
to express <span class="locked">shoes<a name="FNanchor_1410" id="FNanchor_1410" href="#Footnote_1410" class="fnanchor">1410</a></span> occurred less frequently in the writers of
later periods, I conjectured that modern horse-shoes, in order
that they should be distinguished from the ancient shoes,
might have received a particular new name, under which I
had never found them mentioned. In the course of my researches,
therefore, I thought of the Greek word <i>selinaia</i>, the
meaning of which I had before attempted to explain; and I
am now fully convinced that it signifies horse-shoes, such as
those used at present, as has been already remarked by others.
As far as I know, that word occurs, for the first time, in the
ninth century, in the works of the Emperor <span class="locked">Leo<a name="FNanchor_1411" id="FNanchor_1411" href="#Footnote_1411" class="fnanchor">1411</a></span>: and this
antiquity of horse-shoes is in some measure confirmed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">453</a></span>
their being mentioned in the writings of Italian, English, and
French authors of the same century. When Boniface marquis
of Tuscany, one of the richest princes of his time, went to
meet Beatrix, his bride, mother of the well-known Matilda,
about the year 1038, his whole train was so magnificently decorated,
that his horses were not shod with iron but with
silver. The nails even were of the same metal; and when
any of them dropped out they belonged to those who found
them. The marquis appears to have imitated Nero; but this
anecdote may be only a fiction. It is related by a contemporary
writer; but, unfortunately, his account is in verse;
and the author, perhaps sensible of his inability to make his
subject sufficiently interesting by poetical ornaments, availed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">454</a></span>
himself of the license claimed by poets to relate something
singular and <span class="locked">uncommon<a name="FNanchor_1412" id="FNanchor_1412" href="#Footnote_1412" class="fnanchor">1412</a></span>. However this may be, it is certain
that the shoes of the horses must have been fastened on with
nails, otherwise the author could not have mentioned them.</p>

<p>Daniel, the historian, seems to give us to understand that
in the ninth century horses were not shod always, but only in
the time of frost, and on other particular <span class="locked">occasions<a name="FNanchor_1413" id="FNanchor_1413" href="#Footnote_1413" class="fnanchor">1413</a></span>. The
practice of shoeing appears to have been introduced into
England by William the Conqueror. We are informed that

<p class="fn4"><a name="Footnote_1379" id="Footnote_1379" href="#FNanchor_1379" class="fnanchor">1379</a>  A few observations respecting <i>spartum</i> maybe of service to those who
wish to carry their researches further. The ancients, and particularly the
Greeks, understood by that appellation several species of plants which
could be used and manufactured like flax or hemp, and which appear to
have been often mentioned under that general name. The Greeks however
understood commonly by <i>spartum</i> a shrub, the slender branches of which
were woven into baskets of various kinds, and which produced young shoots
that could be prepared and manufactured in the same manner as hemp;
and this plant, as has already been remarked by the old botanists, is the
<i>Spartium junceum</i>, or Spanish broom, which grows wild on dry land, that
produces nothing else, in the Levant and in the southern parts of Europe.
This broom is that described and recommended in Comment. Instituti Bonnoniensis,
vi. p. 118, and vi. p. 349. The French translator of the papers
here alluded to is much mistaken when he thinks, in Journal Economique,
1785, Novembre, that the author speaks of the common broom (<i>Spartium
scoparium</i>) that grows on our heaths. M. Broussonet, in Mémoires d’Agriculture,
par la Société de Paris, 1785, p. 127, has also recommended the
cultivation of the <i>Spart. junceum</i>, under the name of <i>genêt d’Espagne</i>, and
enumerated the many uses to which it may be applied. The people in
Lower Languedoc, especially in the neighbourhood of Lodeve, make of it
table-cloths, shirts and other articles of dress. The offal or rind serves as
firing. This <i>spartum</i> of the Greeks, or <i>Spartium junceum</i> of the botanists,
is the species called by Pliny, book xxxix. chap. 9, <i>genista</i>, and which he
improperly considers as the Spanish and African <i>spartum</i>. The latter is
certainly the <i>Stipa</i> (<i>Macrochloa</i>) <i>tenacissima</i>, which grows in Spain and
Africa, called there at present <i>sparto</i> or <i>esparto</i>, and which is still prepared
and employed as described by Pliny, b. xix. c. 2. Baskets, mattresses, ship-cables,
and other strong ropes were made of it; and when this grass had
been prepared like hemp, it was used for various fine works. Even at
present the Spaniards make of it a kind of shoes called <i>alpergates</i>, with
which they carry on a great trade to the Indies, where they are very useful
on the hot, rocky and sandy soil. [Moritz Willkomm, in his Botanical
Notices from Spain (Annals of Natural History for March 1845), notices
among the most valuable vegetable productions of Spain, “the celebrated
Esparto (<i>Macrochloa tenacissima</i>), which, growing on many of the hills
situated near the sea, forms an important article of trade in South Spain,
since this tough grass is used partly for the plaiting of coverings for rooms
and balconies, and for making various sorts of baskets, especially panniers
for mules, chairs, and the peculiar sandals which are worn all over the
kingdom; and partly worked into ropes, which are in great request, and
are manufactured in great quantity at Marseilles.”] Whether the ancients
made shoes for their cattle of the <i>Spartium junceum</i> or the <i>Stipa tenacissima</i>,
I will not venture to determine. It is probable that the former was
used by the Greeks, and the latter by the Romans; and it is highly worthy
of being here remarked, that in modern times a kind of socks for horses
were made of a species of <i>spartum</i>, as we learn from J. Leonis Africæ Descriptio,
lib. iii. p. 120. The same author however says expressly, p. 96,
that common shoes of iron were also used.</p></div>

shoes, such as ours in Europe, which are not used in this country. As the
roads are slippery and full of stones, these shoes are soon worn out, so that
it is often necessary to change them. For this purpose those who have the
care of the horses always carry with them a sufficient quantity, which they
affix to the portmanteaus. They may however be found in all the villages,
and poor children who beg on the road even offer them for sale, so that it
may be said there are more farriers in this country than in any other;
though, to speak properly, there are none at all.”

Almost the same account is given by Dr. Thunberg, a later traveller in
Japan. “Small shoes or socks of straw,” says he, “are used for horses
instead of iron shoes. They are fastened round the ankle with straw ropes,
hinder stones from injuring the feet, and prevent the animal from stumbling.
These shoes are not strong; but they cost little, and can be found
every where throughout the country.” Shoes of the same kind, the author
informs us, are worn by the inhabitants.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Trans.</span></p></div>

thing belonging to the equipage of a horseman, he says, <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">πέδικλα σελιναῖα
σιδηρὰ μετὰ καρφίων αὐτῶν</span>. I shall here first remark, that after <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">πέδικλα</span>
there ought to be a comma, for by that word is meant the ropes with which
saddled horses were fastened. Du Cange says <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">πεδικλοῦν</span> signifies <i>to bind</i>.
See likewise Scheffer’s Annotations on Mauricii Ars Militaris, p. 395. The
translator also has improperly said, “Pedicla, id est calceos lunatos ferreos
cum ipsis carphiis.” <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">Κάρφια</span> means <i>nails</i>, as Du Cange has proved by several
instances, and here <i>horse-shoe nails</i>. The word may be found for the
second time in the tenth century, in the Tactica of the Emperor Constantine,
where the whole passage, however, is taken from Leo without the
least variation; so that we may suppose Constantine understood it in the
same sense as Leo. It is used, for the third time, by the same emperor,
twice in his book on the Ceremonial of his own court. In p. 265, where
he speaks of the horses (<span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">τὰ ἱππάρια</span>) which were to be procured for the
imperial stable; these, he says, were to be provided with every thing necessary,
and to have also <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">σελιναῖα</span>. In page 267 it is said further, that a
certain number of pounds of iron should be given out from the imperial
stores to make <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">σελιναῖα</span>, and other horse-furniture. The same word is
used a fourth time by Eustathius, who wrote in the twelfth century, in his
commentary on Homer, <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">Χαλκὸν δὲ νῦν λέγει τὰ σελιναῖα ὑπὸ τοῖς ποσὶ
τῶν ἵππων, οἷς διακόπτονται εἰς πλέον τὰ πατούμενα</span>. See Iliad. lib. xi.
152. Though I do not believe that Homer had the least idea of horse-shoes,
I am fully convinced that Eustathius alludes to them by that word.
This commentator has explained very properly various passages of the like
kind in Homer; but he seems here, as was the case sometimes with his
poet himself, to have been asleep or slumbering.
</p>
<p>
When one considers that the <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">σελιναῖα</span>, or <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">σεληναῖα</span>, belonged to horse-furniture;
that they were made of iron; that, as Eustathius says, they were
placed under the hoofs of the horses; that the word seems to show its derivation
from the moon-like form of shoes, such as those used at present;
and lastly, that nails were necessary to these <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">σελιναῖα</span>; I think we may
venture to conclude, without any fear of erring, that this word was employed
to signify horse-shoes of the same kind as ours, and that they were
known, if not earlier, at least in the ninth century.</p></div>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="floating">FLOATING OF WOOD.</h2>

<p>The conveying of wood in floats is an excellent invention; as
countries destitute of that necessary article can be supplied by
water carriage, not only with timber for building and other
useful purposes, but also with fire-wood. The former is either
pushed into the water in single trunks, and suffered to be carried
along by the stream, or a number of planks are ranged close
to each other in regular order, bound together in that manner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">455</a></span>
and steered down the current as boats are, by people accustomed
to such employment. The first method is that most
commonly used for fire-wood. Above floats of the second kind
a load of spars, deals, laths, pipe-staves, and other timber, is
generally placed; and with these, floaters will trust themselves
on broad and rapid rivers, whereas fire-wood is fit to be transported
only on rivulets or small streams; and sometimes canals
are constructed on <span class="locked">purpose<a name="FNanchor_1417" id="FNanchor_1417" href="#Footnote_1417" class="fnanchor">1417</a></span>. However simple the invention
of floating fire-wood may be, I consider the other
method as the oldest; and I confess that I do not remember
to have found in ancient authors any information respecting
the former. Fire-wood was, indeed, not so scarce formerly in
the neighbourhood of large cities as it is at present. Men
established themselves where it was abundant; and they used
it freely, without thinking on the wants of posterity, till its
being exhausted rendered it necessary for them to import it
from distant places. It is probable that the most ancient mode
of constructing vessels for the purpose of navigation gave rise
to the first idea of conveying timber for building in the like
manner; as the earliest ships or boats were nothing else than
rafts, or a collection of beams and planks bound together, over
which were placed deals. By the Greeks they were called
<i>schediai</i>, and by the Latins <i>rates</i>; and it is known from the
testimony of many writers, that the ancients ventured out to
sea with them on piratical expeditions as well as to carry on
commerce; and that after the invention of ships they were
still retained for the transportation of soldiers and of heavy
<span class="locked">burthens<a name="FNanchor_1418" id="FNanchor_1418" href="#Footnote_1418" class="fnanchor">1418</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">456</a></span>
The above conjecture is confirmed by the oldest information
to be found in history respecting the conveyance by water of
timber for building. Solomon entered into a contract with
Hiram, king of Tyre, by which the latter was to cause cedars
for the use of the temple to be cut down on the western side
of Mount Lebanon above Tripoli, and to be floated to Jaffa.
The words at least employed by the Hebrew historian, which
occur nowhere else, are understood as alluding to the conveyance
of timber in floats; and this explanation is considered
by Michaelis as probable. At present no streams run from
Lebanon to Jerusalem; and the Jordan, the only river in Palestine
that could bear floats, is at a great distance from the
cedar forest. The wood, therefore, must have been brought
along the coast by sea to <span class="locked">Jaffa<a name="FNanchor_1419" id="FNanchor_1419" href="#Footnote_1419" class="fnanchor">1419</a></span>. In this manner is the account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">457</a></span>
understood by Josephus; but although he assures us that he
gives the letters of both the kings as they were at that time
preserved in the Jewish and Tyrian annals, it is certain that
they are spurious, and that he took the whole relation from
the sacred books of the Jews which are still extant, as he himself
tells us in the beginning of his <span class="locked">work<a name="FNanchor_1420" id="FNanchor_1420" href="#Footnote_1420" class="fnanchor">1420</a></span>.</p>

<p>An old tradition prevailed that the city Camarina, on the
southern coast of Sicily, was built of the clay or mud which
the river Hipparis carried along with it, and deposited in a lake
of the same name. This account seems to be confirmed by a
passage in Pindar, which Aristarchus quotes in explaining <span class="locked">it<a name="FNanchor_1421" id="FNanchor_1421" href="#Footnote_1421" class="fnanchor">1421</a></span>;
and, according to Bochart, some proof is afforded also by the
name Camarina, as <i>chamar</i> or <i>chomar</i> signifies <span class="locked">sealing-clay<a name="FNanchor_1422" id="FNanchor_1422" href="#Footnote_1422" class="fnanchor">1422</a></span>.
In this tradition there is nothing improbable. In the like manner
the Egyptians drew up mud from the lake Mœris<a name="FNanchor_1423" id="FNanchor_1423" href="#Footnote_1423" class="fnanchor">1423</a>; and
thus do the Dutch at present fish up in bag-nets the fine mud
or slime which chokes up their rivers, such as the Issel, and
which they employ for various uses. This explanation, however,
has not been adopted by the old commentators of Pindar.
<span class="locked">Didymus<a name="FNanchor_1424" id="FNanchor_1424" href="#Footnote_1424" class="fnanchor">1424</a></span> and others assert that the poet alludes to wood for
building the city being conveyed in floats on the river Hipparis.
But whatever opinion may be formed of these elucidations
of the scholiasts, we have reason to conclude that the
inhabitants of Camarina were much better acquainted with the
floating of wood than with drawing up slime by means of bag-nets.</p>

<p>The Romans transported by water both timber for building
and fire-wood. When they became acquainted, during their
wars against the Germans, with the benefit of the common
larch, they caused large quantities of it to be carried on the
Po to Ravenna from the Alps, particularly the Rhætian, and to
be conveyed also to Rome for their most important buildings.
Vitruvius <span class="locked">says<a name="FNanchor_1425" id="FNanchor_1425" href="#Footnote_1425" class="fnanchor">1425</a></span> that this timber was so heavy, that, when alone,
the water could not support it, and that it was necessary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">458</a></span>
carry it on ships or on rafts. Could it have been brought to
Rome conveniently, says he, it might have been used with
great advantage in building. It appears, however, that this
was sometimes done; for we are told that Tiberius caused the
Naumachiarian bridge, constructed by Augustus, and afterwards
burnt, to be rebuilt of larch planks procured from Rhætia.
Among these was a trunk one hundred and twenty feet
in length, which excited the admiration of all <span class="locked">Rome<a name="FNanchor_1426" id="FNanchor_1426" href="#Footnote_1426" class="fnanchor">1426</a></span>.</p>

<p>That the Romans procured fire-wood from Africa, particularly
for the use of the public baths, is proved by the privileges
granted on that account to the masters of ships or rafts
by the emperor <span class="locked">Valentinian<a name="FNanchor_1427" id="FNanchor_1427" href="#Footnote_1427" class="fnanchor">1427</a></span>. Those who have read the writings
of the Latin authors with attention must have remarked
other testimonies; but I have found no mention in the ancients
of floating timber in single planks, or of canals dug for that
purpose; at least as far as I can remember. In the Latin language
also there are scarcely two words that allude to what
concerns the floating of timber; whereas the German contains
more of that kind, perhaps, than are to be found in any other;
and I am thence induced to conjecture that the Germans were
the first who formed establishments for this mode of conveyance
on a large scale.</p>

<p>The earliest information respecting the floating of wood in
Saxony appears to be as old as the year <span class="locked">1258<a name="FNanchor_1428" id="FNanchor_1428" href="#Footnote_1428" class="fnanchor">1428</a></span>, when the
margrave Henry the Illustrious remitted by charter to the
monastery of Porta, the duty collected at Camburg from the
wood transported on the river Saale for the use of the <span class="locked">monastery<a name="FNanchor_1429" id="FNanchor_1429" href="#Footnote_1429" class="fnanchor">1429</a></span>.
It is, however, uncertain whether wood really conveyed
in floats, or transported in boats and lighters, be here
meant. Much clearer information concerning wood floated on
the Saale is contained in a letter, expedited in the year 1410
by the two brothers Frederic and William, landgraves of Thuringia,
and margraves of Misnia, in which, on account of the
scarcity of wood that prevailed in their territories, they so
much lessened the toll usually paid on the Saale as far as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">459</a></span>
Weissenfels, that a Rhenish florin only was demanded for floats
brought on that river to Jena, and two Rhenish stivers for
those carried to Weissenfels; but the proprietors of the floats
were bound to be answerable for any injury occasioned to the
<span class="locked">bridge<a name="FNanchor_1430" id="FNanchor_1430" href="#Footnote_1430" class="fnanchor">1430</a></span>. In the year 1431, Hans Munzer, an opulent citizen
of Freyberg, with the assistance of the then burgomasters, put
a float of wood upon the river Mulda, which runs past the city,
in order that it might be conveyed thither for the use of the
inhabitants and of the mines; which seems to be a proof that
the floating of timber was at that period undertaken by private
persons, on their own risk and at their own expenses. In 1486
the floating of wood on the Mulda by the people of Zwikaw,
was opposed by the neighbouring nobility; but the rights of
the city were protected by the electors. When the town of
Aschersleben built its church in the year 1495, the timber used
for the work was transported on the Elbe from Dresden to
Acken, and thence on the Achse to the place of its destination.
This is the oldest account known of floating timber on the
Elbe. In the year 1521, duke George caused a large canal
to be cut at the village of Plauen, which was supplied with
water from the Weiseritz, and carried as far as Dresden. It
appears that in 1564 there was a float-master, who was obliged
to give security to the amount of four hundred florins; so that
the business of floating must at that time have been of considerable
importance. Floating of wood was undertaken at
Annaberg in 1564, by George Oeder, one of the members of
the council, and established at the expense of 4000 florins. Of
the antiquity of floating in other German states I know nothing
more than what is to be gathered from public ordinances respecting
this object and forests; by which we learn that in
the sixteenth century it was practised in Brandenburg, on the
Elbe, Spree, and Havel; in Bavaria, and in the duchy of
<span class="locked">Brunswick<a name="FNanchor_1431" id="FNanchor_1431" href="#Footnote_1431" class="fnanchor">1431</a></span>.</p>

<p>As the city of Paris had consumed all the wood in its neighbourhood,
and as the price of that article became enormous
on account of the distance of forests and the expense of transporting
it, John Rouvel, a citizen and merchant, in the year
1549, fell upon the plan of conducting wood bound together
along rivers which were not navigable for large vessels. With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">460</a></span>
this view, he made choice of the forests in the woody district
of Morvant, which belonged to the government of Nivernois;
and as several small streams and rivulets had their sources
there, he endeavoured to convey into them as much water as
<span class="locked">possible<a name="FNanchor_1432" id="FNanchor_1432" href="#Footnote_1432" class="fnanchor">1432</a></span>. That great undertaking, at first laughed at, was
completed by his successor René Arnoul, in 1566. The wood
was thrown into the water in single trunks, and suffered to be
driven in that manner by the current to Crevant, a small town
on the river Yonne; where each timber-merchant drew out
his own, which he had previously marked, and, after it was
dry, formed it into floats that were transported from the Yonne
to the Seine, and thence to the capital. By this method large
quantities of timber are conveyed thither at present from Nivernois
and Burgundy, and some also from Franche-Comté.
The French extol highly a beneficial establishment formed by
one Sauterau, in Morvant, at his own expense, by which the
transportation of timber was rendered much more speedy, and
for which a small sum was allowed him from the proprietors
of all the wood floated on the Yonne.</p>

<p>The success of this attempt soon gave rise to others. John
Tournouer and Nicholas Gobelin, two timber-merchants, undertook
to convey floats in the like manner on the Marne;
and canals were afterwards constructed in several places for
the purpose of forming a communication between different
rivers. The French writers consider the transportation of
large floats, <i>trains de bois</i>, like those formed at present, from
the before-mentioned districts, and also from Bourbonnois,
Champagne, Lorraine, Montergis, and other parts of the kingdom,
as a great invention; but I am firmly of opinion that
this method was known and employed in Germany at a much
earlier <span class="locked">period<a name="FNanchor_1433" id="FNanchor_1433" href="#Footnote_1433" class="fnanchor">1433</a></span>.</p>

<p>[Victor Hugo gives the following animated account of
floating rafts. The traveller who ascends the river sees it, so
to speak, coming to him, and then the sight is full of charms.
At each instant he meets something which passes him; at one
time, a vessel crowded with peasants, especially if it be Sunday;
at another, a steam-boat; then a long, two-masted vessel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">461</a></span>
laden with merchandize, its pilot attentive and serious, its
sailors busy, with women seated near the door of the cabin;
here, a heavy-looking boat, dragging two or three after it;
there, a little horse drawing a huge bark, as an ant drags a
dead beetle. Suddenly there is a winding in the river; and
formerly, on turning, an immense raft, a floating house, presented
itself, the oars splashing on both sides. On the ponderous
machine were cattle of all kinds, some bleating, and others
bellowing, when they perceived the heifers peaceably grazing
on the banks. The master came and went, looked at this, then
at that, while the sailors busily performed their respective duties.
A whole village seemed to live on this float,&mdash;on this
prodigious construction of fir.]</p>

<p>The floating of wood seems, like many other useful establishments,
to have been invented or first undertaken by private
persons at their own risk and expense, with the consent
of governments, or at least without any opposition from them;
but, as soon as it was brought to be useful and profitable, to
have been considered among regalia. Hence, therefore, soon
arose the float-regal, which, indeed, on account of the free use
granted of rivers, the many regulations requisite, and its connexion
with the forest-regal, can be sufficiently justified. But
when and where originated the term <i>jus grutiæ</i>, under which
this regal is known by jurists?</p>

<p>The few authors who have turned their thoughts to this
question have not been able, as far as I know, to answer it
with certainty, nor even with probability. They have only
repeated, without making any researches themselves, what
<span class="locked">Stypmann<a name="FNanchor_1434" id="FNanchor_1434" href="#Footnote_1434" class="fnanchor">1434</a></span> has said on the subject; and the latter refers to a
passage of Hadrian Junius, which I shall here more particularly
notice. Junius, speaking of the oldest families in the
Netherlands, says that the family of Wassenaer had formerly
a certain supremacy over the rivers in Rhineland, so that no
one, without their permission, could keep swans on them,
and that the brewers paid for the use of the water a certain
tax called the <i>gruyt-geld</i>, from which arose the <i>jus grutæ</i>.
The origin of this word he did not know; but he conjectured
that it was derived either from <i>gruta</i>, which signifies duckweed
(<i>Lemna</i>), a plant that grows in the water and covers its
surface during the summer, or from <i>grut</i>, an ingredient used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">462</a></span>
in making <span class="locked">beer<a name="FNanchor_1435" id="FNanchor_1435" href="#Footnote_1435" class="fnanchor">1435</a></span>. It is certain that in the tenth, eleventh, and
thirteenth centuries <i>gruta</i>, <i>grutt</i>, or <i>gruit</i>, signified a tax which
brewers were obliged to <span class="locked">pay<a name="FNanchor_1436" id="FNanchor_1436" href="#Footnote_1436" class="fnanchor">1436</a></span>; but the origin of the word has
been sufficiently explained neither by Junius nor any other
writer. I nowhere find that it was used in ancient times for
a float-duty; and this meaning Junius himself has not so much
as once mentioned.</p>

<p>The word <i>gruit</i> occurs under a quite different sense in a
letter of investiture of the year 1593, by which the elector of
Cologne gave as a fief to the countess of Moers, the <i>gruit</i> within
the town of Berg, with all its rents, revenues, and appurtenances.
“No other person was allowed to put <i>grudt</i> or any
plant in beer, or to draw beer brought from other countries.
On the other hand, the countess was to make good <i>grutt</i>, and
to cause it to be sold at the price usual in the neighbouring
parts; she was bound also to supply the elector gratis with
what beer was necessary for family consumption; and if more
was required than usual, on extraordinary occasions, she was
to ask and receive money. If any one in the town did not
deliver good <i>gruidt</i>, and should prove that he could not deliver
better, as the fault was occasioned by the <i>gruitte</i>, the loss
that might arise should fall upon the countess.” The word
<i>grut</i> or <i>gruitt</i> seems to occur here under a double meaning;
as an ingredient in the beer, and as the beer itself which was
made from it. Of this difficulty I have in vain endeavoured
to find an explanation. <i>Grut</i>, perhaps, may signify malt. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">463</a></span>
Dutch and other kindred languages <i>grut</i> means the small refuse
which is separated from anything; and to which <i>grusch</i>
bran, and <i>grütze</i> groats, have an affinity. May not ground
malt be understood by it? I have thought likewise of a kind
of herb-beer, which was much esteemed in the sixteenth century;
and that <i>grut</i> might signify a mixture of herbs used for
making that beer. It is probable that this word was confined
within the boundaries of the Netherlands; and thence only,
perhaps, is an explanation of it to be expected.</p>

<p>I am, however, still unable to comprehend how the float-duty
obtained the name of <i>jus grutiæ</i>; and in our kindred
languages I can find no derivation of it. The German word
<i>flosz</i>, from <i>fliessen</i>, to flow or glide; <i>flusz</i>, a river, occurs in
them all. The Dutch say <i>vlot</i>, <i>vlothout</i>; the Swedes, <i>en flott</i>,
<i>flotta</i>, to float; <i>flot-wed</i>, float-wood; and the English, <i>a float</i>,
<i>to float</i>, &amp;c.</p>

</p>
<p>
The following is the account given of these cedars by the abbé Binos,
who visited them in the year 1778. “Here,” says he, “I first discovered
the celebrated cedars, which grow in an oval plain, about an Italian mile
in circumference. The largest stand at a considerable distance from each
other, as if afraid that their branches might be entangled, or to afford room
for their tender shoots to spring up, and to elevate themselves also in the
course of time. These trees raise their proud summits to the height of
sixty, eighty, and a hundred feet. Three or four, when young, grow up
sometimes together, and form at length, by uniting their sap, a tree of a
monstrous thickness. The trunk then assumes generally a square form.
The thickest which I saw might be about thirty feet round; and this size
was occasioned by several having been united when young. Six others,
which were entirely insulated, and free from shoots, were much taller, and
seemed to have been indebted for their height to the undivided effects of
their sap.” These cedars, formerly so numerous, are now almost entirely
destroyed. In the year 1575, Rauwolff found twenty-four that stood
round about in a circle, and two others, the branches whereof are quite
decayed with age; Bellon, in 1550, counted twenty-eight old trees; Fremenet,
in 1630, counted twenty-two; La Roque, in 1688, twenty; Maundrell,
in 1696, sixteen; Dr. Pococke, in 1738, fifteen; and Schulze, in 1755,
counted twenty, besides some young ones; Burckhardt, in 1810, eleven
or twelve; Dr. Richardson, in 1818, eight; Mr. Robinson, in 1830, seven;
Lord Lindsay, in 1836, seven. Mr. Buckingham, in 1816, differs greatly
from the other authorities, computing the whole number of trees at two
hundred, of which he describes twenty as being very large.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Trans.</span></p></div>

<h2 id="lace">LACE.</h2>

<p>Fifty years ago, when a knowledge of many useful and ingenious
arts formed a part of the education given to young
women destined for genteel life, one who should have supposed
that any reader could be ignorant of the manner in
which lace is made, would only have been laughed at; but as
most of our young ladies at present employ the greater part
of their time in reading romances or the trifles of the day, it
is probable that many who have even had an opportunity of
frequenting the company of the fair sex, may never have seen
the method of working lace. For this reason, I hope I shall
be permitted to say a few words in explanation of an art towards
the history of which I mean to offer such information
as I have been able to collect.</p>

<p>Proper lace or point was not wove. It had neither warp
nor woof, but was rather knit after the manner of nets (<i>filets</i>)
or of stockings. In the latter, however, one thread only is
employed, from which the whole piece or article of dress is
made; whereas lace is formed of as many threads as the pattern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">464</a></span>
and breadth require, and in such a manner that it exhibits
figures of all kinds. To weave, or, as it is called, knit
lace, the pattern, stuck upon a slip of parchment, is fastened
to the cushion of the knitting-box; the thread is wound upon
the requisite number of spindles, which are called bobbins;
and these are thrown over and under each other in various
ways, so that the threads twine round pins stuck in the holes
of the pattern, and by these means produce that multiplicity
of eyes or openings which give to the lace the desired figures.
For this operation much art is not necessary; and the invention
of it is not so ingenious as that of weaving stockings.
Knitting, however, is very tedious; and when the thread is
fine and the pattern complex, it requires more patience than
the modern refinement of manners has left to young ladies
for works of this kind. Such labour, therefore, is consigned
to the hands of indigent girls, who by their skill and dexterity
raise the price of materials, originally of little value, higher
when manufactured than has ever yet been possible by any art
whatever. The price, however, becomes enormous when knit
lace has been worked with the needle or embroidered: in
French it is then called <i>points</i>.</p>

<p>The antiquity of this art I do not pretend to determine with
much certainty; and I shall not be surprised if others by their
observations trace it higher than I can. I remember no passage
in the Greek or Latin authors that seems to allude to it;
for those who ascribe works of this kind to the Romans found
their opinion on the expression <i>opus Phrygianum</i>: but the
art of the <span class="locked">Phrygians<a name="FNanchor_1437" id="FNanchor_1437" href="#Footnote_1437" class="fnanchor">1437</a></span>, as far as I have hitherto been able to
learn, consisted only in needle-work: and those ingenious
borders sewed upon clothes and tapestry, mention of which
occurs in the ancients, cannot be called lace, as they have
been by <span class="locked">Braun<a name="FNanchor_1438" id="FNanchor_1438" href="#Footnote_1438" class="fnanchor">1438</a></span> and other writers. I am however firmly of
opinion that lace worked by the needle is much older than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">465</a></span>
that made by knitting. Lace of the former kind may be found
among old church furniture, and in such abundance that it
could have been the work only of nuns or ladies of fortune,
who had little else to employ their time, and who imagined it
would form an agreeable present to their Maker; for had it
been manufactured as an article of commerce, we must certainly
have found more information respecting it.</p>

<p>We read in different authors that the art of making lace
was brought from Italy, particularly from Genoa and Venice,
to Germany and France; but this seems to allude only to the
oldest kind, or that worked with the needle, and which was by
far the dearest. At any rate, I have nowhere found an expression
that can be applied to lace wove or knit. In the
account given of the establishment of the lace manufacture
under Colbert in 1666, no mention is made but of <i>points</i><a name="FNanchor_1439" id="FNanchor_1439" href="#Footnote_1439" class="fnanchor">1439</a>.</p>

<p>I will venture to assert that the knitting of lace is a German
invention, first known about the middle of the sixteenth century;
and I shall consider as true, until it be fully contradicted,
the account given us that this art was found out, before the
year 1561, at St. Annaberg, by Barbara wife of Christopher
Uttmann. This woman died in 1575, in the sixty-first year
of her age, after she had seen sixty-four children and grandchildren;
and that she was the inventress of this art is unanimously
affirmed by all the annalists of that part of <span class="locked">Saxony<a name="FNanchor_1440" id="FNanchor_1440" href="#Footnote_1440" class="fnanchor">1440</a></span>.
About that period the mines were less productive, and the
making of veils, an employment followed by the families of
the miners, had declined, as there was little demand for them.
This new invention, therefore, was so much used that it was
known in a short time among all the wives and daughters of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">466</a></span>
the miners; and the lace which they manufactured, on account
of the low price of labour, soon became fashionable, in opposition
to the Italian lace worked with the needle, and even
supplanted it in commerce.</p>

<p>A doubt, however, has often occurred to me, which may
probably occur also to some of my readers, that this Barbara
Uttmann may be entitled only to the merit of having made
known and introduced this employment; and that, as has often
happened to those who first brought a new art to their own
country, she may have been considered as the inventress,
though she only learned it in a foreign land, where it had been
long practised. But I conjecture that this could not have
been the case, as I find no mention of the art of knitting lace,
nor any of the terms that belong to it, before the middle of
the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>[The application of machinery to the manufacture of lace
dates from the early part of the present century. The original
fabric, called pillow or bone-lace, which formerly gave employment
to so many <span class="locked">thousands<a name="FNanchor_1441" id="FNanchor_1441" href="#Footnote_1441" class="fnanchor">1441</a></span> of the poorer classes, is now,
especially in this country, almost entirely abandoned, in consequence
of the invention of the bobbin-net machinery.</p>

<p>The bobbin-net trade is a branch of the cotton manufacture,
the net being almost invariably formed of that material. It
originated in successive improvements and alterations on the
stocking-frame, by which it was adapted to the weaving of
lace; though it is deserving of notice that it could have had
no existence but for Samuel Crompton’s invention, the mule,
which spins yarn suitable for that delicate fabric. The application
of the stocking-frame to lace-making was first attempted
by a frame-work knitter of Nottingham, named Hammond,
about 1768; but it was not rendered completely successful
till after improvements by John Heathcoat, also of Nottingham,
for which a patent was secured in 1809. His improvements
were of so important a character as to entitle him to be
justly considered the inventor of the lace-frame, and the father
of the bobbin-net manufacture. Means were besides discovered
for making the net into various widths, instead of only one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">467</a></span>
broad piece as at first, and likewise to work various ornaments
into it by the aid of machinery, which, in point of complex
ingenuity, far surpasses that used in any other branch of human
<span class="locked">industry<a name="FNanchor_1442" id="FNanchor_1442" href="#Footnote_1442" class="fnanchor">1442</a></span>. One of Fisher’s spotting-frames, according to
Dr. Ure, is as much beyond the most curious chronometer in
multiplicity of mechanical device, as that is beyond a common
roasting-jack. The combined effects of these improvements
is, that fabrics, for which £5 were paid during the existence
of Mr. Heathcoat’s patent, may now be purchased for 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
The different systems of bobbin-net machines are described in
Ure’s Dictionary, or his Cotton Manufacture of Great Britain.
It has been found that no machines, except those upon the
circular-bolt principle invented by Mr. Morley of Derby, have
been found capable of working successfully by mechanical
power.]</p>

<h2 id="ultramarine">ULTRAMARINE.</h2>

<p>Ultramarine is a very fine blue powder, almost of the colour
of the corn-flower or blue-bottle, which has this uncommon
property, that, when exposed to the air or a moderate heat, it
neither fades nor becomes tarnished. On this account it is
used in painting; but it was employed formerly for that purpose
much more than at present, as smalt, a far cheaper article,
was not then known. It is made of the blue parts of the lapis
lazuli, by separating them as much as possible from the other
coloured particles with which they are mixed, and reducing
them to a fine powder. The real lapis lazuli is found in the
mountains of that part of Tartary called Bucharia, which extends
eastwards from the Caspian sea, and particularly at Kalab
and Budukschu. It is sent thence to the East Indies, and
from the East Indies to Europe. The Bucharians also carry
fragments of it, weighing sometimes a pound and more, to
Orenburg, though less frequently than some years ago. As
large pieces of a pure and beautiful colour are scarce even in
that distant country, and as they are employed for making ornaments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">468</a></span>
and toys, the rough stone itself is costly; and this high
price is increased in the ultramarine by its laborious preparation,
though in later times the process has been rendered
much <span class="locked">easier<a name="FNanchor_1443" id="FNanchor_1443" href="#Footnote_1443" class="fnanchor">1443</a></span>.</p>

<p>On account of the scarcity and great value of the lapis
lazuli, other stones, somewhat like it only in colour, have
been substituted in its stead; and hence have arisen the many
contradictions to be found in the works of different authors,
particularly those of the ancients, where they speak of the
properties and country of this species of stone. Many have
considered the Armenian stone, which is a calcareous kind of
stone tinged with copper; many the mountain blue or malachite,
and many also blue sparry fluor, and blue jasper, as the
lapis <span class="locked">lazuli<a name="FNanchor_1444" id="FNanchor_1444" href="#Footnote_1444" class="fnanchor">1444</a></span>; and ultramarine of course is not always what it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">469</a></span>
ought to be. At present, smalt of a good colour is often purchased
therefore at a dear rate; and it is in greater request,
as it is certain that its colour is more durable in fire than even
that of the lapis lazuli. Good ultramarine must be of a beautiful
dark colour, and free from sand as well as every other
mixture. It must unite readily with oil; it must not become
tarnished on a red-hot tile or plate of iron, and it ought to
dissolve in strong acids, almost like the zeolite, without causing
any effervescence. In the year 1763, an ounce of it at
Paris cost four pounds sterling, and an ounce of <i>cendre d’outremer</i>,
which is the refuse, two pounds. At Hamburg,
Gleditsch sold fine real Oriental ultramarine for a ducat per
ounce, and warranted it to stand proof by fire; but whether
it would stand proof by acids also, I do not know.</p>

<p>From what has been said, a question arises, whether ultramarine
was known to the ancient Greeks and Romans? And
this gives occasion to another, whether they were acquainted
with lapis lazuli? The name lapis lazuli no one indeed can
expect to find among them; for it is certain that we received
it from the Arabians; and the word <i>ultramarinum</i> is altogether
barbarous Latin. Some centuries ago, many foreign
articles, brought from beyond sea, had a name given them
from that circumstance; and the ancients applied the epithet
<i>marinum</i> to various productions on the like account. Hence,
in the decline of the Roman language was formed <i>ultramarinum</i>,
which some have endeavoured to improve by changing
it into <i>transmarinum</i>, but this among the ancients never signified
a colour.</p>

<p>Though the ancient names of precious stones have neither
been examined with sufficient accuracy nor distinguished with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">470</a></span>
the greatest possible certainty, I think I can discover among
them the lapis lazuli. I consider it as the sapphire of the ancients,
and this opinion has been entertained by others; but
I hope to render it more probable than it has hitherto appeared.
In the first place, the sapphire of the Greeks and
Romans was of a sky-blue colour with a violet or purplish
glance; and sometimes it had a very dark or almost blackish-blue
colour. Secondly, this stone was not transparent. Thirdly,
it had in it a great many gold points, or golden-yellow spots,
but that which had fewest was most esteemed. Fourthly, it
was polished and cut; but when it was not perfectly pure, and
had mixed with it harder extraneous particles, it was not fit for
the hands of the lapidary. Fifthly, it appears that it was procured
in such large pieces that it could be employed for inlaid
or mosaic-work. Sixthly, it was often confounded with, or
compared to, copper-blue, copper-ore, and earth and stones
impregnated with that metal. Seventhly, such medicinal effects
were ascribed to it as could be possessed only by a copper salt;
and lastly, it formed veins in rocks of other kinds of stone, as
we are informed by <span class="locked">Dionysius<a name="FNanchor_1445" id="FNanchor_1445" href="#Footnote_1445" class="fnanchor">1445</a></span>.</p>

<p>That a stone with these properties cannot be the sapphire of
our jewellers is beyond all doubt. Our real sapphire does not
form veins in other fossils, but is found among sand in small
crystals, shaped like diamonds; though they sometimes have
rather the figure of columns. Like other precious stones, they
are always transparent; they have never gold points in them;
their blue colour resembles more or less that of blue velvet,
and it is often very pale, and approaches seldom, or very little,
to purple. Powder of sapphire appears like fine pounded glass,
exhibits no traces of copper, and can in no manner produce a
blue pigment, or be confounded with mountain-blue.</p>

<p>The question, whether the ancients were acquainted with
our sapphire, and whether it may not belong to their amethysts
or hyacinths, I shall not here examine. I am inclined
rather to decide in the negative than the affirmative; and at
any rate the proof will always remain dubious. It might perhaps
be difficult also to determine whether every modern mineralogist
who has spoken of the sapphire was acquainted with,
and alluded to, the real stone of that name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">471</a></span>
On the other hand, we can affirm with the greatest certainty,
that the sapphire of the ancients was our lapis lazuli.
The latter is of a blue colour, which inclines sometimes to
violet or purple, and which is often very dark. It is altogether
opake, yet its colour will admit of being compared to a sky-colour;
in mentioning of which Pliny had no idea of transparency,
for he compares the colour of an opake jasper to a
<span class="locked">sky-blue<a name="FNanchor_1446" id="FNanchor_1446" href="#Footnote_1446" class="fnanchor">1446</a></span>. The lapis lazuli is interspersed with small points,
which were formerly considered as gold, but which are only
particles of pyrites or marcasite. It can be easily cut and
formed into articles of various kinds, and at present it is often
used for seals. Pliny, however, informs us that it was not fit
for this purpose when it was mixed with hard foreign particles,
such as quartz; and that which was of one colour was therefore
much more <span class="locked">esteemed<a name="FNanchor_1447" id="FNanchor_1447" href="#Footnote_1447" class="fnanchor">1447</a></span>. Many cut stones of this kind,
which are considered as antiques, may be found in collections.
I remember to have seen several works of this sort in the excellent
collection of the duke of Brunswick, which, in all probability,
are Egyptian, and which are worthy of an accurate
description. That lapis lazuli was used formerly for inlaid
works I am well convinced, though at present I can produce
no proofs. In how beautiful a manner it is employed for that
purpose in Florentine works, is well known. The largest and
most magnificent squares of lapis lazuli which I ever saw, are
in the apartments at Zarskoe-Selo, a summer palace near Petersburg,
belonging to the empress of Russia, the walls of which
are covered with amber, interspersed with plates of this costly
stone. I was informed that these plates were procured from
Thibet. The doubt expressed by Epiphanius concerning stairs
overlaid with lapis lazuli, respects only the great expense of it,
and he perhaps imagined that the steps were entirely cut from
the solid stone. The confounding the sapphire with the <i>cyanus</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">472</a></span>
or comparing it to it, of which several instances occur,
proves that the former must have had a great resemblance to
copper-ore; for that the <i>cyanus</i> is a kind of mineral or mountain
blue, tinged with copper, I have proved <span class="locked">already<a name="FNanchor_1448" id="FNanchor_1448" href="#Footnote_1448" class="fnanchor">1448</a></span>. The
blue colour of lapis lazuli has always been supposed to be
owing to copper; but according to the latest discoveries it
originates from <span class="locked">iron<a name="FNanchor_1449" id="FNanchor_1449" href="#Footnote_1449" class="fnanchor">1449</a></span>. The medicinal effects which the ancients
ascribed to their sapphire could be produced only from
a mixture of copper, as they considered the Armenian stone,
or false lapis lazuli, to be the real kind. They recommended
copper ochre for an inflammation of the <span class="locked">eyes<a name="FNanchor_1450" id="FNanchor_1450" href="#Footnote_1450" class="fnanchor">1450</a></span>. In the last
place it agrees with what Dionysius says, that the sapphire
or lapis lazuli was produced in veins among other kinds of
<span class="locked">stone<a name="FNanchor_1451" id="FNanchor_1451" href="#Footnote_1451" class="fnanchor">1451</a></span>. The sapphire also mentioned in the oldest writings of
the Hebrews, appears to be no other than the sapphire of the
Greeks, or our lapis lazuli; for it was said likewise to be interspersed
with gold <span class="locked">points<a name="FNanchor_1452" id="FNanchor_1452" href="#Footnote_1452" class="fnanchor">1452</a></span>.</p>

<p>The ancients therefore were acquainted with our lapis lazuli;
but the question whether they used it as a paint, or
prepared ultramarine from it, I cannot answer with sufficient
certainty. It is possible that their <i>cæruleum</i> sometimes may
have been real ultramarine; but properly and in general it
was only copper <span class="locked">ochre<a name="FNanchor_1453" id="FNanchor_1453" href="#Footnote_1453" class="fnanchor">1453</a></span>. The objection that the ancients
made blue glass and blue enamel, and if they had not smalt
they could use no other pigment that would stand fire but
ultramarine, I shall answer in the next article.</p>

<p>Before I proceed to the oldest information with which I am
acquainted respecting ultramarine, or the blue colour made
from lapis lazuli, I shall communicate what I know of the
origin and antiquity of the name commonly given to this stone.
That I might be able to offer something more on the subject
than what has been said by <span class="locked">Salmasius<a name="FNanchor_1454" id="FNanchor_1454" href="#Footnote_1454" class="fnanchor">1454</a></span>, I requested the opinion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">473</a></span>
of Professor Tychsen, which, with his permission, I have
here <span class="locked">subjoined<a name="FNanchor_1455" id="FNanchor_1455" href="#Footnote_1455" class="fnanchor">1455</a></span>. It is, in the first place, certain that the word
is of Persian derivation, and the stone, as I have already remarked,
has hitherto been brought to us from Persia. Secondly,
it signifies a blue colour. It was at first also the common
name in Europe for blue stones and blue colours used in
painting; and it was a long time used to express mountain-blue
impregnated with copper. The modern systematic mineralogists,
it appears, first appropriated the corrupted Persian
word to the present lazur-stone, properly so-called; and those
therefore would commit an error in mineralogy who should
now apply this name to the Armenian stone, mountain-blue,
or any other blue mineral containing copper.</p>

<p>Without pretending to have discovered the first mention of
the name lazuli in those writings which have been handed
down to us, I shall here offer, as the oldest with which I am acquainted,
that found in <span class="locked">Leontius<a name="FNanchor_1456" id="FNanchor_1456" href="#Footnote_1456" class="fnanchor">1456</a></span>, who, where he gives directions
for colouring a celestial globe, speaks of <i>lazurium</i>. If
Fabricius be right, Leontius lived in the sixth <span class="locked">century<a name="FNanchor_1457" id="FNanchor_1457" href="#Footnote_1457" class="fnanchor">1457</a></span>.
Among the receipts for painting, written in the eighth century,
which <span class="locked">Muratori<a name="FNanchor_1458" id="FNanchor_1458" href="#Footnote_1458" class="fnanchor">1458</a></span> has made known, we find an unintelligible
account how to make <i>lazuri</i>, for which <i>cyanus compositus</i>,
perhaps a prepared kind of mountain-blue, was to be
employed. There is also another receipt which orders blue-bottles
to be pounded in a mortar. It appears therefore that
this word was used in the corrupted Latin of that period to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">474</a></span>
signify a blue colour for painting. The same word, formed
after the Greek manner, seems to have been used for blue by
Achmet, the astrologer, who lived in the ninth <span class="locked">century<a name="FNanchor_1459" id="FNanchor_1459" href="#Footnote_1459" class="fnanchor">1459</a></span>, and
by Nonus in the tenth for a blue <span class="locked">earth<a name="FNanchor_1460" id="FNanchor_1460" href="#Footnote_1460" class="fnanchor">1460</a></span>. Of still more importance
is a passage of Arethas, who lived in the following
century, and who, in his exposition of a verse in the book of
<span class="locked">Revelation<a name="FNanchor_1461" id="FNanchor_1461" href="#Footnote_1461" class="fnanchor">1461</a></span>, says, the sapphire is that stone, of which <i>lazurium</i>,
as we are told, is <span class="locked">made<a name="FNanchor_1462" id="FNanchor_1462" href="#Footnote_1462" class="fnanchor">1462</a></span>. This, therefore, is a strong
corroboration that the sapphire of the ancients was our <i>lapis
lazuli</i>, and appears to be the first certain mention of real ultramarine.
The word however occurs often in the succeeding
centuries for blue copper-ochre. Constantinus Africanus, a
physician of the eleventh century, ascribes to lapis lazuli the
same medicinal qualities as those of <span class="locked">copper-ochre<a name="FNanchor_1463" id="FNanchor_1463" href="#Footnote_1463" class="fnanchor">1463</a></span>; as do also
Avicenna, Averroes, and Myrepsius. The first, under the
letter <i>lam</i>, gives a chapter entitled <i>lazuard</i>, to which the
translator has prefixed “De azulo, id est, de lapide Armenio;”
and the last says expressly, that the <i>lapis lazuli</i> of the Latins
is the <i>lazurios</i> of the <span class="locked">Greeks<a name="FNanchor_1464" id="FNanchor_1464" href="#Footnote_1464" class="fnanchor">1464</a></span>. The words <i>azura</i>, <i>azurum</i>,
<i>azurrum</i>, occur often also in that century for <i>blue</i>.</p>

<p>The name <i>ultramarine</i>, or, as it was first called, <i>azurrum ultramarinum</i>,
I have not yet found in any writer of the fifteenth
century. But it appears that it must have been common about
the end of that century, as it was used by Camillus Leonardus
in <span class="locked">1502<a name="FNanchor_1465" id="FNanchor_1465" href="#Footnote_1465" class="fnanchor">1465</a></span>. It is probable that it originated in Italy. In the
first half of the sixteenth century Vanuccio Biringoccio gave
directions for preparing the real ultramarine, which he distinguishes
with sufficient accuracy from copper <span class="locked">azur<a name="FNanchor_1466" id="FNanchor_1466" href="#Footnote_1466" class="fnanchor">1466</a></span>, or, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">475</a></span>
calls it, the <i>azurro dell’ Alemagna</i>. At that period, however,
the best method of preparing it must have been doubtful as
well as little known, and on that account of no great benefit;
for, in the beginning of the sixteenth century, the father of
the celebrated Giambatista Pigna, an apothecary at Modena,
was in possession of the secret for making the best ultramarine,
by which he acquired more riches than would have
arisen from a large <span class="locked">estate<a name="FNanchor_1467" id="FNanchor_1467" href="#Footnote_1467" class="fnanchor">1467</a></span>. It is not, therefore, altogether
true that Alexius Pedemontanus, as Spielmann <span class="locked">relates<a name="FNanchor_1468" id="FNanchor_1468" href="#Footnote_1468" class="fnanchor">1468</a></span>, was
the first person who mentioned ultramarine. I am of opinion
that this Alexius, or Hieronymus Ruscellai concealed under
that name, who wrote in the beginning of the sixteenth century,
only first published a complete account of the method of
preparing it. At any rate, his receipt was long followed as
the best and the most <span class="locked">certain<a name="FNanchor_1469" id="FNanchor_1469" href="#Footnote_1469" class="fnanchor">1469</a></span>. But on what information is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">476</a></span>
that assertion founded, which we read in English and French
<span class="locked">authors<a name="FNanchor_1470" id="FNanchor_1470" href="#Footnote_1470" class="fnanchor">1470</a></span>, that the preparation of ultramarine was found out
in England, and that a servant of the East India Company
disclosed it, in order to be revenged for some injury which he
had sustained?</p>

<p>[The following is the method of making ultramarine from
lapis lazuli. The finest mineral is selected, heated to a dull
red heat, and quenched in water; it is thus rendered friable,
and is ground down into an impalpable powder. This is then
mixed with a tenacious paste made of linseed oil, wax, resin,
turpentine and mastic; and the mixture being kneaded in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">477</a></span>
warm water gives out the blue particles, which are afterwards
collected by subsidence.</p>

<p>Chemists are not agreed concerning the cause of the colour
of ultramarine. Dr. Eisner considers it to arise from sulphuret
of sodium and of iron, the former being a higher sulphuret
than the latter. MM. Clement and Desormes show that the
iron is not essential, either to the lapis lazuli, or to the pigment
made from it.</p>

<p>An artificial method of making ultramarine was discovered
in 1828 by M. Guimet; the process has been kept secret.
Processes have also been discovered by M. Gmelin of Tübingen,
M. Persoz of Strasburg, and others. M. Gmelin’s process
consists in fusing a mixture of two parts of sulphur and
one of dry carbonate of soda in a Hessian crucible, and then
sprinkling into it by degrees another mixture of silicate of
soda and aluminate of soda. The crucible must be exposed
to the fire for an hour after this. The ultramarine thus prepared
contains a little sulphur, which can be separated by
means of water.</p>

<p>Some valuable observations on this subject have lately been
published by M. Prückner<a name="FNanchor_1471" id="FNanchor_1471" href="#Footnote_1471" class="fnanchor">1471</a>. He states that the materials required
in the preparation of ultramarine are alumina, sulphate
of soda, sulphur, charcoal and a salt of iron, the common sulphate
or green vitriol being the best. The alumina is supplied
in white bole, or a very pure white clay. The sulphate of
soda is reduced by charcoal and heat to the state of sulphuret,
and its solution thus obtained afterwards boiled with sulphur
so as to form a persulphuret (penta-sulphuret, Berz.). The solution
is then mixed with the dried clay and stirred; during the
mixing a solution of green vitriol is added and mixed. It is
then dried and very finely powdered as rapidly as possible. It
is afterwards heated in a muffle; then washed, drained and
again heated in a muffle; finally it is again washed, dried and
powdered.]</p>

in Tartary, the same thing is confirmed by Tavernier in his Travels. Paulus
Venetus also seems to speak of that country when he says, “Suppeditat
quoque mons alius in hac provincia (Balascia) lazulum, de quo fit azurum
optimum, quale etiam in mundo non invenitur. Elicitur autem ex mineris
non secus ac ferrum; præbent quoque mineræ argentum.” A great many
however assert that this species of stone is brought from Persia: but it is
not indigenous in that country, and is carried thither from Thibet. As the
Persians are remarkably fond of this paint, they endeavour to procure as
much of it as possible; but Persia itself produces only the blue copper
ochre, which is sometimes used there instead of ultramarine. Tavernier
mentions this very particularly, and, as he dealt in precious stones, was not
liable to be deceived. To rectify a prevailing mistake, I shall here insert
his own words:&mdash;“In the copper mines of Persia, veins of lazur, which is
much used in that country, and with which the flowers on the ceiling and
roofs of apartments are painted, have also been found. Before these were
discovered, the Persians had no other lazur than the real kind which comes
from Tartary, and is exceedingly dear. The Persian lazur is a sort of copper
ore; and when the stone is pounded and sifted, which is the process
employed with the real kind, it forms a fine paint, which appears very
bright and pleasant. After this discovery, the Persians durst no more
purchase the Tartarian lazur; and Mahomet-Beg issued an order that
painters should not use foreign but Persian lazur. This prohibition however
did not long continue; for the Persian lazur could not stand the effects
of the atmosphere like the real kind, but in the course of time became of
a dark and dismal colour. Sometimes it was full of scales, and would not
hang to the end of a soft hair brush. On this account it was soon neglected
as a coloured earth, and the lazur of Tartary again introduced.” This
information is confirmed also by Chardin, in Voyages en Perse, iv. p. 66.
“In the country around Tauris,” says the author, “is found lapis lazuli,
but it is not so good as that of Tartary, as its colour changes, becomes
dark, and afterwards fades.” In page 255, he says likewise, “The lapis
lazuli, called <i>lagsverd</i>, from which we have formed the word <i>azur</i>, is found
in the neighbourhood, in the country of the Yousbecs, but the general
magazine for it is Persia.” I do not believe that this species of stone was
formerly procured from Cyprus, as is asserted in many books. Copper is
a production of that island, and it produces even at present mountain blue.
Those also who assert that the colour of ultramarine fades in the fire,
must not have been acquainted with the genuine sort. See Schriften der
Schwedischen Acad. xii. p. 69. Montamy, in Abhandlung von den
Farben zum Porzellan, Leipzig, 1767, 8vo, p. 121, affirms that ultramarine
is not good for enamel-painting, but it is certain that it was once used for
that purpose.</p></div>

if I here give an account of the author, according to such information as I
have been able to obtain. Conrad Gesner seems not to have known anything
of him, as he is not mentioned either in his Epistolæ Medicinales or
his Bibliotheca. Ciaconius, in Bibliotheca Libros et Scriptores fere cunctos
complectens, Parisiis, 1731, fol. p. 94, says that his real name was Hieronymus
Ruscellai. The same account is given by Haller in Biblioth. Botan., &amp;c.
Gobet, in Les Anciens Minéralogistes de France, Paris, 1779, 8vo, ii. p. 705,
tells us that this Jerome Ruscellai died in 1565; and that his book was
composed from his papers by Franc. Sansovino, who published many works
not his own, and printed for the first time at Milan, in 1557. I have nowhere
found a particular account of this Ruscellai; and indeed it is always
laborious to search out any of that noble family, which I have already spoken
in the article Lacmus. He appears to me to be none of those mentioned in
Jochers Gelehrten-Lexicon. I have met with no earlier edition of his works
than that of 1557: but I suspect that the first must be older. However
much the book may have been sought after, it seems to me improbable that
three editions should be published in Italian in the course of the first year;
for, besides that of Milan, two editions printed at Venice the same year,
one in quarto and another in octavo, are still extant. A French translation
also was published at Antwerp, in 1557. Is it possible that an English
translation could be published at London in 1558, if the original appeared
for the first time only in 1557? At that period translations were not made
so speedily. The Secrets of Alexis, London, 1558, is mentioned in Ames’s
Typographical Antiquities, p. 296. I have in my possession a French translation
by Christofle Landré, Paris, 1576, 12mo, which I seldom find quoted.
It has a large appendix, collected from various authors.
</p>
<p>
It is well-known that Joh. Jacob Wecker, a physician at Colmar, translated
into Latin this book of Alexius, and enlarged it with additions, under
the title of De Secretis Libri xvii. The first edition, as Haller says, was
printed at Basle in 1559, 8vo. Every edition seems to differ from the preceding;
many things are omitted, and the new additions are for the most
part of little importance. I have the edition of Basle, 1592, 8vo, in which
there is a great deal not to be found in that of 1662, and which wants some
things contained in the edition of 1582. The latest editions are printed
from that improved by Theod. Zwinger, Basle, 1701, 8vo. The last by
Zwinger, was published at Basle in 1753. Though these books on the arts, as
they are called, contain many falsehoods, they are still worthy of some notice,
as they may be reckoned among the first works printed on technology, and
have as much induced learned men to pay attention to mechanics and the
arts, as they have artists to pay attention to books and written information.</p></div>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="cobalt">COBALT, ZAFFER, SMALT.</h2>

<p>The name cobalt is given at present to that metal and its ores,
the oxides of which are largely employed in the manufactures
of glass, porcelain and pottery, for the production of a blue
colour. The cobalt ores are first roasted and freed from foreign
mineral bodies, particularly sulphur, iron, nickel, bismuth,
and arsenic, with which they are united, and then well calcined,
and sold, either mixed or unmixed with fine sand, under
the name of zaffer (<i>zaffera</i>); or the cobalt is melted with siliceous
earth and potash to a kind of blue glass called smalt,
which, when ground very fine, is known in commerce by the
name of powder-blue. All these articles, because they are
most durable pigments, and those which best withstand fire,
and because one can produce with them every shade of blue,
are employed, above all, for tinging crystal and for enamelling;
for counterfeiting opake and transparent precious stones, and
for painting and varnishing real porcelain and earthen and
potters’ ware. This colour is indispensably necessary to the
painter when he is desirous of imitating the fine azure colour
of many butterflies and other natural objects; and the cheaper
kind is employed to give a blueish tinge to new-washed linen,
which so readily changes to a disagreeable yellow.</p>

<p>The preparation of this new colour may be reckoned among
the most beneficial inventions of modern times. It rendered
of importance an useless and hurtful production; gave employment
to a number of hands; assisted in bringing many
arts to a degree of perfection which they could never before
attain; and has drawn back to Germany a great deal of money
which was formerly sent out of it for foreign articles.</p>

<p>Though there is no doubt that the process used in the preparation
of cobalt and smalt was invented about the end of the
fifteenth or the beginning of the sixteenth century, we have
reason to ask whether the ancients were acquainted with cobalt,
and if they employed it for colouring glass. They opened
and worked mines in various parts; and it is at any rate
possible that they may have found cobalt; they made many
successful attempts to give different tints to <span class="locked">glass<a name="FNanchor_1472" id="FNanchor_1472" href="#Footnote_1472" class="fnanchor">1472</a></span>; and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">479</a></span>
produced blue glass and blue enamel. They may have learned
by an accident to make this glass, as they did to make brass;
and they may have continued to make the former as long as
their supply of coloured earth lasted. When the mineral failed
them, they may have lost the art, in the same manner as the
method of preparing Corinthian <span class="locked">brass<a name="FNanchor_1473" id="FNanchor_1473" href="#Footnote_1473" class="fnanchor">1473</a></span> was lost for a considerable
space of time. The use of cobalt does not imply a
knowledge of its metal; for the moderns made brass and smalt
for whole centuries, before they learned to prepare zinc and
regulus of cobalt.</p>

<p>It seems, however, difficult to answer this question; for one
can scarcely hope to discover cobalt with any certainty among
those minerals mentioned by the ancients. They could describe
minerals in no other manner than according to their
exterior appearance, the country where they were found, or
the use to which they applied them. Now there is no species
more various and more changeable in its figure and colour than
cobalt ore, which on this account shows the impossibility of
distinguishing minerals with sufficient accuracy by external
characteristics. Besides, there are scarcely two passages of the
ancients which seem to allude to it; and these, when closely
examined, give us little or no information.</p>

<p>The meaning of the term <i>cadmia</i> is as various and uncertain
as that of the word <i>cobalt</i> was two centuries ago. It signified
often calamine; sometimes furnace-dross; and perhaps, in later
times, also arsenic; but, as far as I know, it was never applied
to cobalt till mineralogists wished in modern times to find a
Latin term for <span class="locked">it<a name="FNanchor_1474" id="FNanchor_1474" href="#Footnote_1474" class="fnanchor">1474</a></span>, and assumed that which did not belong
properly to any other mineral. The well-known passage of
<span class="locked">Pliny<a name="FNanchor_1475" id="FNanchor_1475" href="#Footnote_1475" class="fnanchor">1475</a></span>, in which Lehmann thinks he can with certainty distinguish
cobalt, is so singular a medley that nothing to be
depended on can be gathered from it. The author, it is true,
where he treats of mineral pigments, seems to speak of a blue
sand which produced different shades of blue paint, according
as it was pounded coarser or finer. The palest powder was
called <i>lomentum</i>; and this Lehmann considers as our powder-blue.
I am however fully convinced that the <i>cyanus</i> of Theophrastus,
the <i>cæruleum</i> of Pliny, and the <i>chrysocolla</i><a name="FNanchor_1476" id="FNanchor_1476" href="#Footnote_1476" class="fnanchor">1476</a>, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">480</a></span>
the blue copper earth often already mentioned, which may have
been mixed and blended together. Besides, Pliny clearly adds
to it an artificial colour, which in my opinion was made in the
same manner as our lake; for he speaks of an earth, which
when boiled with plants, acquired their blue colour, and which
was in some measure inflammable. With these pigments walls
were painted; but as many of them would not endure lime,
they could be used only on those which were plastered with
clay (<i>creta</i>). The expression <i>usus ad fenestras</i> has been misapplied
by Lehmann, as a strong proof of his assertion; for
he explains it as if Pliny had said that a blue pigment was
used for painting window-frames; but glass windows were at
that time unknown. I suspect Pliny meant to say only that
one kind of paint could not be employed near openings which
afforded a passage to the light, as it soon decayed and lost its
colour. This would have been the case in particular with
lake in which there was a mixture of vegetable particles.</p>

<p>For my part, I find in this passage as few traces of smalt
as M. Gmelin; and I agree with him in opinion that the strong
and unpleasant mixtures arising from cobalt would, had it
been known, have induced the ancients to make particular
mention of it in their writings. Would not the arsenic, which
is so often combined with cobalt, have given occasion to many
reports respecting the dangerous properties of these minerals?
And would not arsenic and bismuth have been sooner known,
had preparations of cobalt been made at so early a period?
It is a circumstance of great weight also, that in the places
where the ancients had mines, and where antiquities painted
or tinged blue, and resembling in colour that produced by
cobalt, have been dug up, cobalt has not been discovered, or
has been discovered only in modern times. At present we
know nothing of Egyptian, Arabian, Ethiopian, Italian, and
Cyprian cobalt; and in <span class="locked">Spain<a name="FNanchor_1477" id="FNanchor_1477" href="#Footnote_1477" class="fnanchor">1477</a></span> this mineral was first found in
the reign of Philip IV. I shall here observe, that the island
of Cyprus was formerly so abundant in copper, that, in a
mineralogical sense, it might be called the island of Venus;
and we can therefore entertain the less doubt that the <i>cæruleum
Cyprium</i> was copper-blue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">481</a></span>
The principal reason, however, why Lehmann, <span class="locked">Pauw<a name="FNanchor_1478" id="FNanchor_1478" href="#Footnote_1478" class="fnanchor">1478</a></span>, Ferber,
Delaval, and others, think that the ancients used smalt,
and were acquainted with cobalt, is that, as has been already
said, various antiquities both of painting and enamel have been
discovered, in which a blue appears that seems to give grounds
for conjecturing that it was produced by cobalt. <span class="locked">Ferber<a name="FNanchor_1479" id="FNanchor_1479" href="#Footnote_1479" class="fnanchor">1479</a></span>
speaks of blue glass squares in mosaic-work; and Delaval
mentions old Egyptian glass-work of this <span class="locked">colour<a name="FNanchor_1480" id="FNanchor_1480" href="#Footnote_1480" class="fnanchor">1480</a></span>. It is well
known also that the Chinese and people of Japan gave to
their porcelain that fine blue colour, for which it is celebrated,
long before the discovery of smalt in Europe. On mummies
a blue is seen likewise, which, even after so many centuries,
seems to have lost little or nothing of its <span class="locked">beauty<a name="FNanchor_1481" id="FNanchor_1481" href="#Footnote_1481" class="fnanchor">1481</a></span>. We must
therefore allow that the ancients used either ultramarine or
cobalt.</p>

<p>The first opinion seems, in regard of porcelain, to be confirmed
by <span class="locked">Duhalde<a name="FNanchor_1482" id="FNanchor_1482" href="#Footnote_1482" class="fnanchor">1482</a></span>, who speaks of a mine of <i>azur</i>, and relates
that the Chinese, in modern times, use instead of it, for
painting their porcelain, a blue colour brought from foreign
countries. It is probable that by the former he means lapis
lazuli, and by the latter smalt, which is sent in large quantities
from Europe to China. The invention of ultramarine,
however, appears to me too new, its effect on porcelain too
uncertain, and its price too high to allow us to suppose that it
has been much used. We should therefore have been almost
obliged to adopt the latter opinion, had not M. Gmelin proved
by chemical <span class="locked">experiments<a name="FNanchor_1483" id="FNanchor_1483" href="#Footnote_1483" class="fnanchor">1483</a></span> that it is not only possible to give
to glass and enamel a blue colour by means of iron, but that
the before-mentioned antiquities, upon which so much stress
has been laid, show not the smallest traces of cobalt. He even
made experiments upon blue tiles, found in a Roman tessellated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">482</a></span>
foot-pavement at Montbeillard; and likewise on the
blue paint of the mummy which was presented to our university
by the king of <span class="locked">Denmark<a name="FNanchor_1484" id="FNanchor_1484" href="#Footnote_1484" class="fnanchor">1484</a></span>. He has also mentioned various
articles on which a blue colour is produced by the vitrification
of iron. Of this nature are in particular those slags
found near the smelting-houses at the iron-mines of the Harz
forest; and I myself have seen slags which were of a blue colour
exceedingly beautiful. Volcanic slags, or scoriæ, found in the
neighbourhood of Verona, Vicenza, and other parts of Italy,
are mentioned also by <span class="locked">Ferber<a name="FNanchor_1485" id="FNanchor_1485" href="#Footnote_1485" class="fnanchor">1485</a></span>, which seems to confirm the
conjecture of Dr. <span class="locked">Bruckmann<a name="FNanchor_1486" id="FNanchor_1486" href="#Footnote_1486" class="fnanchor">1486</a></span>, that the ancients may have
used such slags for their works. It is probable that the ancients
were first induced by the blue slag of their smelting-houses
to make experiments on the colouring of glass with
iron, and that in this art they acquired a dexterity not possessed
at present, because it was abandoned by our ancestors
after the invention of smalt, which is much more beautiful;
and which can be used more easily and with more certainty.
I cannot, however, deny that I have often lamented this loss
when I saw the excellent blue in the painted windows at
Gouda, Goslar, and other places; though its beauty is much
heightened by the transparency of the glass, and the strong
light that falls upon it from without.</p>

<p>I shall now proceed to the invention of the colour prepared
from cobalt. About the end of the fifteenth century, cobalt
appears to have been dug up in great quantity in the mines
on the borders of Saxony and Bohemia, discovered not long
before that period. As it was not known at first to what
purpose it could be applied, it was thrown aside as a useless
mineral. The miners had an aversion to it, not only because
it gave them much fruitless labour, but because it often
proved prejudicial to their health by the arsenical particles with
which it was combined; and it appears even that the mineralogical
name <i>cobalt</i> then first took its rise. At any rate, I
have never met with it before the beginning of the sixteenth
century; and Mathesius and Agricola seem to have first used
it in their writings. Frisch derives it from the Bohemian
word <i>kow</i>, which signifies metal; but the conjecture that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">483</a></span>
was formed from <i>cobalus</i>, which was the name of a spirit that,
according to the superstitious notions of the times, haunted
mines, destroyed the labours of the miners, and often gave
them a great deal of unnecessary trouble, is more probable;
and there is reason to think that the latter is borrowed from
the Greek. The miners, perhaps, gave this name to the
mineral out of joke, because it thwarted them as much as the
supposed spirit, by exciting false hopes and rendering their
labour often <span class="locked">fruitless<a name="FNanchor_1487" id="FNanchor_1487" href="#Footnote_1487" class="fnanchor">1487</a></span>. It was once customary, therefore, to
introduce into the church service a prayer that God would
preserve miners and their works from <i>kobolts</i> and spirits.</p>

<p>Respecting the invention of making a useful kind of blue
glass from cobalt, we have no better information than that
which <span class="locked">Klotzsch<a name="FNanchor_1488" id="FNanchor_1488" href="#Footnote_1488" class="fnanchor">1488</a></span> has published from the papers of Christian
Lehmann. The former, author of an historical work respecting
the upper district of the mines in Misnia, and a clergyman
at Scheibenberg, collected with great diligence every
information in regard to the history of the neighbouring
country, and died, at a great age, in 1688. According to his
account, the colour-mills, at the time when he wrote, were
about a hundred years old; and as he began first to write towards
the end of the thirty years’ war, the invention seems to
fall about 1540 or 1560. He relates the circumstance as follows:
“Christopher Schurer, a glass-maker at Platten, a place
which belongs still to Bohemia, retired to Neudeck, where he
established his business. Being once at Schneeberg, he collected
some of the beautiful coloured pieces of cobalt which
were found there, tried them in his furnace; and finding that
they melted, he mixed some cobalt with the vitreous mass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">484</a></span>
and obtained fine blue glass. At first he prepared it only for
the use of the potters; but in the course of time it was carried
as an article of merchandize to Nuremberg, and thence to
Holland. As painting on glass was then much cultivated in
the latter, the artists there knew better how to appreciate this
invention. Some Dutchmen therefore repaired to Neudeck,
in order that they might learn the process used in preparing
this new colour. By great promises they persuaded the inventor
to remove to Magdeburg, where he also made glass
from the cobalt of Schneeberg; but he again returned to his
former residence, where he constructed a hand-mill to grind
his glass, and afterwards erected one driven by water. At
that period the colour was worth seven dollars and a half per
cwt., and in Holland from fifty to sixty florins. Eight colour-mills
of the same kind, for which roasted cobalt was procured
in casks from Schneeberg, were soon constructed in Holland;
and it appears that the Dutch must have been much better
acquainted with the art of preparing, and particularly with
that of grinding it, than the Saxons; for the elector John
George sent for two colour-makers from Holland, and gave a
thousand florins towards enabling them to improve the art.
He was induced to make this advance chiefly by a remark of
the people of Schneeberg, that the part of the cobalt which
dropped down while it was roasting contained more colour
than the roasted cobalt itself. In a little time other colour-mills
were erected around Schneeberg. Hans Burghard, a
merchant and chamberlain of Schneeberg, built one by which
the eleven mills at Platten were much injured. Paul Nordhoff,
a Frieslander, a man of great ingenuity, who lived at the
Zwitter-mill, made a great many experiments in order to improve
the colour, by which he was reduced to so much poverty
that he was at length forced to abandon that place, where he
had been employed for ten years in the colour-manufactory.
He retired to Annaberg, established there in 1649, by the
assistance of a merchant at Leipsic, a colour-manufactory, of
which he was appointed the director; and by these means
rendered the Annaberg cobalt of utility. The consumption
of this article however must have decreased in the course of
time; for in the year 1659, when there were mills of the same
kind at more of the towns in the neighbourhood of mines, he
had on hand above 8000 quintals.” Thus far Lehmann.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">485</a></span>
This information is in some measure confirmed by <span class="locked">Melzer<a name="FNanchor_1489" id="FNanchor_1489" href="#Footnote_1489" class="fnanchor">1489</a></span>,
who says that the mines of Schneeberg, which were first discovered
in the middle of the fifteenth century, had declined so
much towards the middle of the sixteenth, that it was impossible
to get any profit by them till the year 1550, when a
greater advantage arose from the new method of using cobalt.
About this period a contract was entered into with the Dutch,
who agreed to take the roasted cobalt at a certain price.
<span class="locked">Lehmann<a name="FNanchor_1490" id="FNanchor_1490" href="#Footnote_1490" class="fnanchor">1490</a></span> says, but without adducing any proofs, that a
manufactory for making blue glass was erected by Sebastian
Preussler, between Platten and Eybenstock, so early as 1571.
<span class="locked">Rossler<a name="FNanchor_1491" id="FNanchor_1491" href="#Footnote_1491" class="fnanchor">1491</a></span>, who died in 1673, in the seventy-sixth year of his
age, gives us to understand that a century and a half before
his time, cobalt was procured and sold as zaffer; but that the
colour-mills in the country had been established only about
sixty years. I conjecture therefore that the roasted cobalt,
to which sand was added, in order that the nature of it might
be better concealed, and the further preparation of it rendered
more difficult, was given up to the Dutch, even so early as
the beginning of the sixteenth <span class="locked">century<a name="FNanchor_1492" id="FNanchor_1492" href="#Footnote_1492" class="fnanchor">1492</a></span>, and that these people
by melting it anew, or at any rate by pounding it finer, derived
the greatest benefit from it long before the Saxons
themselves constructed mills according to the model of those
used in Holland. At present many Dutchmen grind German
cobalt with very great <span class="locked">advantage<a name="FNanchor_1493" id="FNanchor_1493" href="#Footnote_1493" class="fnanchor">1493</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">486</a></span>
It appears that this new colour was not made known in
books till a late period. Agricola was not acquainted with
the blue glass, nor is zaffera mentioned either by him or Mathesius.
Albin also, who indeed derived the greater part of
his information from these two writers, says not a word respecting
it; but he tells us that bismuth when put in vessels
grew together <span class="locked">again<a name="FNanchor_1494" id="FNanchor_1494" href="#Footnote_1494" class="fnanchor">1494</a></span>. He seems therefore to allude to cobalt
roasted and mixed with sand, which when packed up becomes
a solid body, whereas bismuth which has been purified by
roasting can never assume that state. Vanuccio Biringoccio,
the oldest writer in whose works I have as yet observed the
name <i>zaffera</i>, describes its use for painting glass, and calls it
a heavy mineral, without defining it any further. <span class="locked">Cardan<a name="FNanchor_1495" id="FNanchor_1495" href="#Footnote_1495" class="fnanchor">1495</a></span>
gives the name of zaffera to an earth which colours glass blue.
Cæsalpin says it is a <span class="locked">stone<a name="FNanchor_1496" id="FNanchor_1496" href="#Footnote_1496" class="fnanchor">1496</a></span>; and Julius Scaliger must have
known as little of it, else he would have mentioned it in his
Exercitations on Cardan. Porta, who employed great diligence
to acquire knowledge of this kind, often mentions <i>zaphara
figlinorum</i>, without telling us what it is; but he describes
how it must be melted, poured into water, pounded,
sifted, and reduced into a fine powder in order to be employed
for making artificial precious <span class="locked">stones<a name="FNanchor_1497" id="FNanchor_1497" href="#Footnote_1497" class="fnanchor">1497</a></span>. Neri, who wrote about
the year <span class="locked">1609<a name="FNanchor_1498" id="FNanchor_1498" href="#Footnote_1498" class="fnanchor">1498</a></span>, knew nothing more of it; and Merret, the
commentator on Neri, who lived in the middle of the sixteenth
<span class="locked">century<a name="FNanchor_1499" id="FNanchor_1499" href="#Footnote_1499" class="fnanchor">1499</a></span>, confesses that he knew not what zaffera was, but he
believed that it was a new German invention, at least that it
was brought from Germany, and that it seemed to him to be
made from copper and sand, with the addition perhaps of calamine.
The first person who properly explained zaffera in
his writings, and gave a correct account of the method of
preparing it, is, in my opinion, <span class="locked">Kunkel<a name="FNanchor_1500" id="FNanchor_1500" href="#Footnote_1500" class="fnanchor">1500</a></span> in his annotations on
Neri and Merret. That writer says, zaffera was by the miners
called <i>zafloer</i>, and that sand was mixed with it only that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">487</a></span>
powder-blue used by women for linen, and by painters called
blue smalt, might not be imitated in other countries.</p>

<p>Rosler says the Bohemian cobalt is not so good as that of
Misnia, and that its colour is more like that of ashes. That
Brandt, a member of the Council of Mines in Sweden, first
asserted that cobalt contained a peculiar kind of metal, must
be so well known to mineralogists, that it scarcely deserves to
be <span class="locked">mentioned<a name="FNanchor_1501" id="FNanchor_1501" href="#Footnote_1501" class="fnanchor">1501</a></span>.</p>

<p>That these fowls, which at present are everywhere common,
were brought to us from a different part of the world, is, I believe,
generally admitted; but respecting their original country,
and the time when they were first introduced into Europe,
there is much difference of opinion among those who in later
times have made researches on that <span class="locked">subject<a name="FNanchor_1502" id="FNanchor_1502" href="#Footnote_1502" class="fnanchor">1502</a></span>. I shall therefore
compare what has been advanced on both sides with what
I have remarked myself, and submit my decision to the judgement
of the reader.</p>

<p>The question, whether turkeys or turkey-fowls were known
to the Greeks and the Romans, will depend upon defining what
those fowls were to which they gave the name of <i>meleagrides</i>
and <i>gallinæ Africanæ</i>; for in the whole ornithology of the
ancients, there are no other kind that can occasion doubt. It
has however been justly remarked by Perrault and others,
that every thing which we find related by the ancients of the
<i>meleagrides</i> can be applied only to the pintado or Guinea fowl
(<i>Numida meleagris</i>, Linn.), and not to the turkey; and that
the <i>gallinæ Africanæ</i> were only a variety of the former, or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">488</a></span>
species that approached nearly to them. Their spots, disposed
in such a manner as if formed by drops, on account of which,
in modern times, they have been called <i>pintados</i> and <i>pientades</i>,
and the marks on the feathers of the wings, accord perfectly
with the description given of them by Clytus, the scholar of
<span class="locked">Aristotle<a name="FNanchor_1503" id="FNanchor_1503" href="#Footnote_1503" class="fnanchor">1503</a></span>; though in northern countries, some Guinea fowls
are found, the colour of which is more mixed with white.
But this is a variation not uncommon among birds in general
when removed from their native country, as is proved by the
white peacocks, which were first observed in Norway. The
coloured hood of thick skin which covers the head has also
been accurately described by Clytus, as well as the coloured
fleshy excrescence on the bill (<i>palearia carunculacea</i>). In
size the <i>meleagrides</i> were like our largest common fowls, which
is true also of the pintado; and we must acknowledge with
Clytus, that its naked head is too small in proportion to the
body. The figure of the pintado, like that of the partridge,
and its drooping tail, correspond equally well with the epithet
<i>gibberæ</i>, especially as the position of its feathers occasions its
back to appear elevated or bent upwards. The feet are like
those of the domestic fowl, but they are destitute of the spurs
with which those of the latter are furnished; and the pintado
lays spotted eggs, as described by Aristotle; but these, by the
manner in which the fowls are reared in Europe, are liable to
variations. It deserves to be remarked above all, that both
sexes of the <i>meleagrides</i> are so like, that they can scarcely be
distinguished; and this circumstance alone is sufficient to confute
those who pretend that the <i>meleagrides</i> were our turkeys.
Had that been the case, it is impossible that Clytus in his description,
which seems to have been drawn up with great care,
should have omitted the proud and ridiculous gestures of the
turkey-cock when he struts about with his tail spread out like
a fan, or thrown into a circular form, and his wings trailing
on the ground, or the long excrescence that hangs down from
his bill, and the tuft of black hair on his breast. The unpleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">489</a></span>
cry, and the unsocial disposition of the <i>meleagrides</i>,
are observed in the Guinea fowls, which, as the ancients justly
remarked, frequent rivers and marshes, where turkeys on the
other hand never thrive.</p>

<p>The ancients assure us that the native country of the <i>meleagrides</i>
was <span class="locked">Africa<a name="FNanchor_1504" id="FNanchor_1504" href="#Footnote_1504" class="fnanchor">1504</a></span>, where the Guinea fowls are still found
in a wild state, but where our turkeys were never seen wild.
When writers however mention places not in Africa, to
which the former were brought, we are not to suppose that
they were carried thither directly from Africa. The difference
which Columella and <span class="locked">Pliny<a name="FNanchor_1505" id="FNanchor_1505" href="#Footnote_1505" class="fnanchor">1505</a></span> make between the <i>meleagrides</i>
and <i>gallinæ Africanæ</i> is so trifling, as to imply only
a variety of the species; and the opinion of Pallas, who has
occasionally collected a number of important observations
which may serve to explain the natural history of the ancients,
is highly probable, that we are to understand under it
the <i>Numida mitrata</i>, which he has described. The red crest
which the last-mentioned bird always has, and which almost
alone distinguishes it from the common Guinea fowl, seems
fully to prove this <span class="locked">opinion<a name="FNanchor_1506" id="FNanchor_1506" href="#Footnote_1506" class="fnanchor">1506</a></span>. I shall here take occasion to
remark, that Buffon erroneously affirms that the Guinea fowls,
which were transmitted from the Greeks and the Romans, became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">490</a></span>
extinct in Europe in the middle ages; for we find mention
made of them in English writers, under the name of <i>Aves
Africanæ</i>, <i>Afræ</i>, so early as about the year <span class="locked">1277<a name="FNanchor_1507" id="FNanchor_1507" href="#Footnote_1507" class="fnanchor">1507</a></span>.</p>

<p>That the ancients were not acquainted with our turkeys is
still further confirmed by the testimony of various historians
and travellers, who assure us in the first place, that these birds
are still wild in America; secondly, that they were brought
to us from that country; and thirdly, that before the discovery
of the New World they were not known in Europe. Besides,
we are enabled, from the information which they give us, to
see how and when these animals were conveyed to those countries
where they at present are reared as domestic fowls; and
these proofs appear to me so strong, that I conclude Barrington
asserted the contrary, that he might obtain assent not so
much by the force of truth as by advancing absurdities. All
animals multiply more easily, and become larger, stronger, and
more fruitful in those places which nature has assigned to them
for a residence, that is, where they originally lived wild; and
this observation seems to hold good in regard to the turkeys
in America. It is indeed probable that the number of wild
animals will always decrease in proportion as countries are
peopled, and as woods are cut down and deserts cultivated;
it is probable also, that at last no wild animals will be left, as
has been the case with sheep, oxen and horses, which have all
long ago been brought into a state of slavery by man. The
testimony therefore of those who first visited America, and
who found there wild turkeys, deserves the greater attention.</p>

<p>The first author in whom I find mention of them is Oviedo,
who wrote about the year <span class="locked">1525<a name="FNanchor_1508" id="FNanchor_1508" href="#Footnote_1508" class="fnanchor">1508</a></span>. He has described them
minutely with that curiosity and attention which new objects
generally excite; and as he was acquainted with no name for
these animals, till then unknown to the Europeans, he gave
them that which he thought best suited to their figure and
shape. He calls them a kind of peacocks, and he relates that
even then, on account of their utility, and the excellent taste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">491</a></span>
of their flesh, they were not only reared and domesticated by
the Europeans in New Spain, where they were first found, but
that they were carried also to New Castille, and to the West
India islands. The other fowls likewise which he describes
we have without doubt procured from America, such for example
as the <i>Crax alector</i><a name="FNanchor_1509" id="FNanchor_1509" href="#Footnote_1509" class="fnanchor">1509</a>. Lopez de Gomara, whose book
was printed in 1553, makes use of the name <i>gallopavo</i>; and
says that the animal resembles in shape the peacock and the
domestic cock; and that of all the fowls in New Spain its flesh
is the most <span class="locked">delicious<a name="FNanchor_1510" id="FNanchor_1510" href="#Footnote_1510" class="fnanchor">1510</a></span>. In the year 1584 wild turkeys were
found in <span class="locked">Virginia<a name="FNanchor_1511" id="FNanchor_1511" href="#Footnote_1511" class="fnanchor">1511</a></span>. René de Laudonniere found them on his
landing in North America in <span class="locked">1564<a name="FNanchor_1512" id="FNanchor_1512" href="#Footnote_1512" class="fnanchor">1512</a></span>. Fernandez also reckons
them among the birds of Mexico; and takes notice of the difference
between those that were wild and those which had
been <span class="locked">tamed<a name="FNanchor_1513" id="FNanchor_1513" href="#Footnote_1513" class="fnanchor">1513</a></span>. Pedro de Ciesa saw them on the isthmus of
<span class="locked">Darien<a name="FNanchor_1514" id="FNanchor_1514" href="#Footnote_1514" class="fnanchor">1514</a></span>, and Dampier in <span class="locked">Yucatan<a name="FNanchor_1515" id="FNanchor_1515" href="#Footnote_1515" class="fnanchor">1515</a></span>. Besides the testimony
of many other later travellers which have been already quoted
by Buffon, and which I shall not here repeat, the accounts of
Kalm and Smyth in particular deserve to be noticed. The
former, who visited Pennsylvania in 1784, says, “The wild
turkeys run about here in the woods. Their wildness excepted,
they are in nothing different from ours, but in being
generally a little larger, and in having redder flesh, which is,
however, superior in taste. When any one finds their eggs in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">492</a></span>
the woods, and places them under a tame hen to be hatched,
the young, for the most part, become tame also; but when
they grow up they make their escape. On this account people
cut their wings before they are a year old. These wild
turkeys, when tamed, are much more mischievous than those
tamed by <span class="locked">nature<a name="FNanchor_1516" id="FNanchor_1516" href="#Footnote_1516" class="fnanchor">1516</a></span>.” Smyth assures us that wild turkeys are
so abundant in the uncultivated country behind Virginia, and
the southern provinces, that they may be found in flocks of
more than five <span class="locked">thousand<a name="FNanchor_1517" id="FNanchor_1517" href="#Footnote_1517" class="fnanchor">1517</a></span>.</p>

<p>These testimonies, in my opinion, are sufficiently strong and
numerous to convince any naturalist that America is the native
country of these fowls; but their weight will be still increased
if we add the accounts given us when and how they were
gradually dispersed throughout other countries. Had they
been brought from Asia or Africa some centuries ago, they
must have been long common in Italy, and would have been
carried thence over all Europe. We, however, do not find
that they were known in that country before the discovery of
America. It is certain that there were none of them there at
the time when Peter de Crescentio wrote, that is to say, in
the thirteenth <span class="locked">century<a name="FNanchor_1518" id="FNanchor_1518" href="#Footnote_1518" class="fnanchor">1518</a></span>; else he would not have omitted to
mention them where he describes the method of rearing all
domestic fowls, and even peacocks and partridges. The earliest
account of them in Italy is contained in an ordinance
issued by the magistrates of Venice, in 1557, for repressing
luxury, and in which those tables at which they were allowed
are particularised. About the year 1570 Bartolomeo Scappi,
cook to pope Pius V., gave in his book on cookery several receipts
for dressing these expensive and much-esteemed <span class="locked">fowls<a name="FNanchor_1519" id="FNanchor_1519" href="#Footnote_1519" class="fnanchor">1519</a></span>.
That they were scarce at this period appears from its being
remarked that the first turkeys brought to Bologna were some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">493</a></span>
that had been given as a present to the family of Buonocompagni,
from which Gregory XII., who at that time filled the
papal chair, was descended.</p>

<p>That these fowls were not known in England in the beginning
of the sixteenth century, is very probable; as they are
not mentioned in the particular description of a grand entertainment
given by archbishop <span class="locked">Nevil<a name="FNanchor_1520" id="FNanchor_1520" href="#Footnote_1520" class="fnanchor">1520</a></span>; nor in the regulations
made by Henry VIII. respecting his household, in which all
fowls used in the royal kitchen are <span class="locked">named<a name="FNanchor_1521" id="FNanchor_1521" href="#Footnote_1521" class="fnanchor">1521</a></span>. They were,
however, introduced into that country about the above period;
some say in the year 1524; others, in 1530; and some, in
<span class="locked">1532<a name="FNanchor_1522" id="FNanchor_1522" href="#Footnote_1522" class="fnanchor">1522</a></span>. We know, at any rate, that young turkeys were served
up at a great banquet in <span class="locked">1555<a name="FNanchor_1523" id="FNanchor_1523" href="#Footnote_1523" class="fnanchor">1523</a></span>; and about 1585 they were
commonly reckoned among the number of delicate <span class="locked">dishes<a name="FNanchor_1524" id="FNanchor_1524" href="#Footnote_1524" class="fnanchor">1524</a></span>.</p>

<p>According to the account of some writers, turkeys must
have been known much earlier in France; but on strict examination
no proofs of this can be found. The earliest period
assigned for their introduction into that country is given by
<span class="locked">Beguillet<a name="FNanchor_1525" id="FNanchor_1525" href="#Footnote_1525" class="fnanchor">1525</a></span>, who confidently asserts that they were brought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">494</a></span>
Dijon under the reign of Philip the Bold, about the year 1385.
Had this French author quoted his authority, we might have
discovered what gave rise to his mistake; but as he has not,
one cannot help suspecting that the whole account is a fiction
of his own. De la Mare also is in an error when he relates
that the first turkeys in France were those which Jaques Cœur,
the well-known treasurer to Charles VII., brought with him
from the Levant, and kept on his estate in Gatinois, after he
had received the king’s permission to return to the kingdom.
This Cœur, however, who was banished in 1450, never returned,
but died in the island of Chio in the year <span class="locked">1456<a name="FNanchor_1526" id="FNanchor_1526" href="#Footnote_1526" class="fnanchor">1526</a></span>.
Equally false is the account given by Bouche in his History
of Provence, that René, or Renatus, king of Naples and duke
of Anjou, first brought turkeys into the kingdom, and reared
them in abundance at <span class="locked">Rosset<a name="FNanchor_1527" id="FNanchor_1527" href="#Footnote_1527" class="fnanchor">1527</a></span>. This author gives as his authority
the oral tradition of the neighbourhood, which certainly
cannot be put in competition with testimony of a more authentic
nature. Another <span class="locked">Bouche<a name="FNanchor_1528" id="FNanchor_1528" href="#Footnote_1528" class="fnanchor">1528</a></span>, who a few years ago wrote
also a History of Provence, and who has collected many things
that do honour to Renatus, makes no mention of this service,
though he could not be ignorant of what had been before related
by his namesake. Had these fowls been known so
early as the time of that monarch, who died in 1480, it is
impossible that they could have been so scarce in France as
they really were above a hundred years after. The assertion,
often repeated, but never indeed proved, that they were first
brought to France by Philip de Chabot, admiral under Francis
I., is much more probable. Chabot died in 1543; and
what Scaliger says, that in 1540 some turkeys were still remaining
in France, may be considered as alluding to the above
circumstance. This much however is certain, that Gyllius,
who died in 1555, gave soon after the first scientific description
of them, which has been inserted both by Gesner and
Aldrovandus in their works on ornithology. The same year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">495</a></span>
the first figure of them was published by Bellon. About the
same time they were described also by La Bruyere-Champier,
who expressly remarks that they had a few years before been
brought to France from the Indian islands discovered by the
Portuguese and the <span class="locked">Spaniards<a name="FNanchor_1529" id="FNanchor_1529" href="#Footnote_1529" class="fnanchor">1529</a></span>. How then could Barrington
assert that this Frenchman meant the East and not the West
Indies? They must, however, have been a long time scarce
in France; for, in the year 1566, when Charles IX. passed
through Amiens, the magistrates of that place did not disdain
to send him, among other presents, twelve <span class="locked">turkeys<a name="FNanchor_1530" id="FNanchor_1530" href="#Footnote_1530" class="fnanchor">1530</a></span>. This
information seems to agree with the account often quoted,
that the first turkeys were served up, as a great rarity, at the
wedding dinner of that monarch in the year <span class="locked">1570<a name="FNanchor_1531" id="FNanchor_1531" href="#Footnote_1531" class="fnanchor">1531</a></span>; but it
seems the breed of these fowls was not very common under
Charles IX.; for they are not named in the ordinances of 1563
and 1567, in which all other fowls are mentioned. In the
year 1603, Henry IV. caused higglers to be punished who
carried away turkeys from the country villages without paying
for them, under a pretence that they were for the use of the
<span class="locked">queen<a name="FNanchor_1532" id="FNanchor_1532" href="#Footnote_1532" class="fnanchor">1532</a></span>. I shall here also remark, that I can nowhere find
that the Jesuits are entitled to the merit of having introduced
these fowls into <span class="locked">France<a name="FNanchor_1533" id="FNanchor_1533" href="#Footnote_1533" class="fnanchor">1533</a></span>.</p>

<p>As these American fowls must have been carried to Germany
through other lands, we cannot expect to find them in that
country at an earlier period. Gesner, who published his Ornithology
in 1555, seems not even to have seen them. We
are, however, assured by several authors, such as B. <span class="locked">Heresbach<a name="FNanchor_1534" id="FNanchor_1534" href="#Footnote_1534" class="fnanchor">1534</a></span>,
<span class="locked">Colerus<a name="FNanchor_1535" id="FNanchor_1535" href="#Footnote_1535" class="fnanchor">1535</a></span> and others, that turkeys were brought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">496</a></span>
Germany so early as 1530; and in the same year carried to
Bohemia and <span class="locked">Silesia<a name="FNanchor_1536" id="FNanchor_1536" href="#Footnote_1536" class="fnanchor">1536</a></span>. Respecting the northern countries, I
know only, on the authority of Pontoppidan, that they had
been in Denmark two hundred years before his time.</p>

<p>As these fowls are found at present both in Asia and Africa,
it may be worth while to inquire at what period they were
carried thither, especially as these quarters of the world have
been by some considered as their native countries. In China
there are no other turkeys than those which have been introduced
from other parts, as we are expressly assured by Du
Halde, though he erroneously adds that they were quite common
in the East Indies. They were carried to Persia by the
Armenians and other trading people, and to Batavia by the
<span class="locked">Dutch<a name="FNanchor_1537" id="FNanchor_1537" href="#Footnote_1537" class="fnanchor">1537</a></span>. In the time of Chardin they were so scarce in Persia
that they were kept in the Emperor’s <span class="locked">menagerie<a name="FNanchor_1538" id="FNanchor_1538" href="#Footnote_1538" class="fnanchor">1538</a></span>. In the
kingdom of Congo, on the Gold Coast, and at Senegal, there
are none but those belonging to the European factories. According
to Father de Bourzes there are none of them in the
kingdom of Madura; and we are told by Dampier that this
is the case in the island of Mindanao. Prosper Alpinus also
gives the same account in regard to Nubia and Egypt; and
Gemelli Carreri says there is none of them in the Philippines;
though I agree with Buffon in laying very little stress upon
the Travels known under that name, which we have reason to
suppose not genuine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">497</a></span>
It is worthy of remark, that Cavendish found a great number
of turkeys in the island of St. Helena so early as the year
1588; and Barrington misapplies this circumstance to prove
that these fowls did not come from America. It is, however,
very doubtful whether Cavendish really meant our turkeys, as
he says, “Guiney cocks, which we call <span class="locked">turkeys<a name="FNanchor_1539" id="FNanchor_1539" href="#Footnote_1539" class="fnanchor">1539</a></span>;” for the first
name belongs to what are at present called pintados; and it is
therefore uncertain which kind ought here to be understood.
But even allowing that they were turkeys, is it improbable
that they should be on an island which had often been visited
by the Portuguese? The account of De la Croix is of as
little weight; for he says that in the woods of Madagascar
there are many <i>coqs d’Inde</i><a name="FNanchor_1540" id="FNanchor_1540" href="#Footnote_1540" class="fnanchor">1540</a>. De la Croix published his book
in 1688, at which time there were in South America wild
horses and wild cattle. Does this, therefore, invalidate the
certainty of these animals being carried thither from Europe?</p>

<p>I intended to enter into a critical examination of those
grounds upon which Barrington endeavours to prove that
turkeys were originally brought from Africa; but on reading
over his essay once more, I find the greater part of his arguments
are sufficiently refuted by what I have proved from the
most authentic testimony; and nothing now remains but to
add a few observations. Barrington considers it improbable
that these fowls should be so soon spread all over Europe, as
Cortez first visited Mexico in 1519, subdued the capital in
1521, and returned to Spain in 1527. To me, however, it
does not appear incredible; for I could prove by several instances,
that the curiosity excited by the most remarkable
American productions soon became general. Those, for example,
who take the trouble to inquire into the history of
maize or Turkish corn will make the same remark; though it
is a truth fully established that we procure that grain from
America. How soon did tobacco become common! In the
year 1599 the seeds were brought to Portugal; and in the
beginning of the seventeenth century it began to be cultivated
in the East Indies. When Barrington asserts that these fowls
were carried to America by the Europeans, in the same manner
as horses and cattle, this argument may be turned against
himself; for he must doubtless find it equally improbable that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">498</a></span>
they should so soon become common, numerous and wild, in
the New World, as they must have been according to the
authorities above quoted.</p>

<p>As many fat turkeys were purchased yearly in Languedoc
and sent to Spain in the time of cardinal <span class="locked">Perron<a name="FNanchor_1541" id="FNanchor_1541" href="#Footnote_1541" class="fnanchor">1541</a></span>, it is thence
concluded that these fowls were not brought to France through
the latter. Perron died in 1620. At that period turkeys
were very common; and whoever is acquainted with the industry
of the Spaniards will not find it strange that the French
should begin earlier to make the rearing of these animals an
employment. How falsely should we reason, were we to say
that it is impossible the English and French should procure
the best wool from Spain, because the Spaniards purchase the
best cloth from the French and the English!</p>

<p>One proof by which Barrington endeavours to show that
turkeys were esteemed so early as the fifteenth century is very
singular. He quotes from Leland’s Itinerary that <i>capons of
Grease</i> were served up at an entertainment, under Edward IV.,
in 1467. The passage alluded to I cannot find; but an author
must be very self-sufficient and bold indeed, to convert <i>capons
of Grease</i> into <i>capons of Greece</i>, and to pretend that these
were <span class="locked">turkeys<a name="FNanchor_1542" id="FNanchor_1542" href="#Footnote_1542" class="fnanchor">1542</a></span>.</p>

<p>What, however, most excites my surprise is, that the name
of these fowls even should be assumed by this writer as a
ground for his assertion. Had they, says he, been brought
from America, they would have been called American or
West Indian fowls; as if new objects had names given to them
always with reflection. Names are often bestowed upon objects
before it is known what they are or whence they are
procured. Ray, <span class="locked">Minshew<a name="FNanchor_1543" id="FNanchor_1543" href="#Footnote_1543" class="fnanchor">1543</a></span>, and others have been induced by
the name turkey-fowls to consider Turkey as their original
country; but whoever is versed in researches of this kind
must know that new foreign articles are often called Turkish,
Italian, or Spanish. Is Turkey the original country of maize?
or is Italy the original country of these birds, because they
have been sometimes called Italian fowls? Even allowing
that turkeys had acquired their German name (<i>kalekuter</i>) from
Calicut, this, at any rate, would prove nothing further than
that it was once falsely believed that these animals were brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">499</a></span>
from Calicut to Europe: but I suspect that the appellation
<i>kalekuter</i>, as well as the names <i>truthenne</i>, <i>putjen</i>, and <i>puten</i>,
were formed from their cry. Chardin offers a conjecture
which is not altogether to be neglected. That traveller thinks
that these fowls were at first considered as a species of the domestic
fowl, and that they were called Indian, because the
largest domestic fowls are produced in that country.</p>

prove that the <i>meleagrides</i> of the ancients were our Guinea fowls, because
I had no intention of treating fully on a subject which has been handled
by so many others; and because I had only to show that they were not
turkeys. Had not this been the case, it would have been necessary for me
to collect into one point of view everything that the ancients have said of
these fowls, with the words used by the different writers. It may however
be said, that by this mode of examining a disputed point, a mode indeed
practised by many, the reader may be led to an ill-founded approbation,
because what is not agreeable to the author’s assertion may be easily
concealed. But this observation is not applicable to me; for I confess
that I do not know with certainty whether the Guinea fowls are as careless
of their young as the <i>meleagrides</i> are said to have been; whether their
cry, which I have often enough heard, and which is indeed unpleasant,
agrees with the <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">κακκάζειν</span> of Pollux, v. § 90; and whether the <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">ἀλεκτρυόνες

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="butter">BUTTER.</h2>

<p>Milk, the most natural and the commonest food of man, is a
mixture of three component parts, whey, butter, and cheese.
The caseous part is viscous; the butter is the fat, oily, and
inflammable part, and properly speaking, is not perfectly dissolved
in the serum or whey, but rather only diffused through
it like an emulsion, so that it may be separated by rest alone,
without any artificial preparation. When milk is in a state of
rest, the oily part rises to the surface, and forms what is called
cream. When the milk has curdled, which will soon be the
case, the caseous parts separate themselves from the whey; and
this separation may be effected also by the addition of some
mixture, through means of which the produce is liable to many
variations. The caseous part, when squeezed and mixed with
salt, and sometimes herbs, and when it has been moulded into
a certain form and dried, is used under the name of cheese,
which will always be better, the greater the butyraceous part
is that has been left in it. The cream skimmed, and by proper
agitation in a churn or other vessel separated from the whey
and caseous parts, becomes our usual butter.</p>

<p>This substance, though commonly used at present in the
greater part of Europe, was not known, or known very imperfectly,
to the <span class="locked">ancients<a name="FNanchor_1544" id="FNanchor_1544" href="#Footnote_1544" class="fnanchor">1544</a></span>. The ancient translators of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">500</a></span>
Hebrew <span class="locked">writers<a name="FNanchor_1545" id="FNanchor_1545" href="#Footnote_1545" class="fnanchor">1545</a></span> seem however to have thought that they
found it mentioned in <span class="locked">Scripture<a name="FNanchor_1546" id="FNanchor_1546" href="#Footnote_1546" class="fnanchor">1546</a></span>: but those best acquainted
with biblical criticism, unanimously agree that the word <i>chamea</i>
signifies milk or cream, or sour thick milk, and at any rate
does not mean <span class="locked">butter<a name="FNanchor_1547" id="FNanchor_1547" href="#Footnote_1547" class="fnanchor">1547</a></span>. The word plainly alludes to something
liquid, as it appears that <i>chamea</i> was used for washing the
feet, that it was drunk, and that it had the power of intoxicating;
and we know that mares’-milk, when sour, will produce
the like effect. We can imagine streams of milk, but
not streams of butter. This error has been occasioned by the
seventy interpreters, who translate the Hebrew word by the
word <i>boutyron</i>. These translators, who lived two hundred
years after Hippocrates, and who resided in Egypt, might, as
Michaelis remarks, have been acquainted with butter, or have
heard of it; but it is highly probable that they meant cream,
and not our usual butter. Those who judge from the common
translation, would naturally conclude that the passage in Proverbs,
chap. xxx., describes the preparation of butter by shaking
or beating; but the original words signify squeezing or
pressing, <i>pressio</i>, <i>frictio mulgentis educit lac</i>; so that milking
and not making butter is alluded to.</p>

<p>The oldest mention of butter, though it is indeed dubious
and obscure, is in the account given of the Scythians by <span class="locked">Herodotus<a name="FNanchor_1548" id="FNanchor_1548" href="#Footnote_1548" class="fnanchor">1548</a></span>.
“These people,” says he, “pour the milk of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">501</a></span>
mares into wooden vessels, cause it to be violently stirred or
shaken by their blind slaves, and separate the part that arises
to the surface, as they consider it more valuable and more delicious
than that which is collected below it.” The author
here certainly speaks of the richest part of the milk being
separated from the rest by shaking; and it appears that we
have every reason to suppose that he alludes to butter, especially
as Hippocrates, who was almost contemporary, mentions
the same thing, but in a much clearer <span class="locked">manner<a name="FNanchor_1549" id="FNanchor_1549" href="#Footnote_1549" class="fnanchor">1549</a></span>. “The Scythians,”
says the latter, “pour the milk of their mares into
wooden vessels, and shake it violently; this causes it to foam,
and the fat part, which is light, rising to the surface, becomes
what is called butter. The heavy and thick part, which is
below, being kneaded and properly prepared, is, after it has
been dried, known by the name of <i>hippace</i>. The whey or
serum remains in the middle.” This author, in my opinion,
speaks here very distinctly of butter, cheese and whey. It is
probable that the Scythians may have hastened the separation
of the caseous part from the whey by warming the milk, or
by the addition of some substance proper for that purpose.
These passages therefore contain the first mention of butter,
which occurs several times in Hippocrates, and which he prescribes
externally as a <span class="locked">medicine<a name="FNanchor_1550" id="FNanchor_1550" href="#Footnote_1550" class="fnanchor">1550</a></span>; but he gives it another
term (<i>pikerion</i>), which seems to have been in use among the
Greeks earlier than the former, and to have been afterwards
neglected. That this word signified butter, and was no longer
employed in the time of Galen, appears from his translating
it, in his explanation of the obsolete expressions of Hippocrates,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">502</a></span>
by the word <i>boutyron</i><a name="FNanchor_1551" id="FNanchor_1551" href="#Footnote_1551" class="fnanchor">1551</a>. It was even before that period
explained in the same manner by Erotian, in his dictionary
of the words used by that Greek physician; and he
remarks, from an ancient writer, that the Phrygians called
butter <i>pikerion</i>, and that the Greeks seemed to have borrowed
the word from these people. It however occurs very seldom,
and is to be found neither in Hesychius, Suidas, nor
<span class="locked">Pollux<a name="FNanchor_1552" id="FNanchor_1552" href="#Footnote_1552" class="fnanchor">1552</a></span>.</p>

<p>The poet Anaxandrides, who lived soon after Hippocrates,
describing the wedding of Iphicrates, who married the daughter
of Cotys, king of Thrace, and the Thracian entertainment given
on that occasion, says that the Thracians ate <span class="locked">butter<a name="FNanchor_1553" id="FNanchor_1553" href="#Footnote_1553" class="fnanchor">1553</a></span>, which the
Greeks at that time considered as a wonderful kind of food.</p>

<p>It is very remarkable that the word butter does not occur
in Aristotle, and that he even scarcely alludes to that substance,
though we find in his works some very proper information
respecting milk and cheese, which seems to imply
careful observation. At first he gives milk only two component
parts, the watery and the caseous; but he remarks
afterwards, for the first time, in a passage where one little expects
it, that in milk there is also a fat substance, which under
certain circumstances, is like <span class="locked">oil<a name="FNanchor_1554" id="FNanchor_1554" href="#Footnote_1554" class="fnanchor">1554</a></span>.</p>

<p>In Strabo there are three passages that refer to this subject,
but from which little information can be obtained. This
author says that the Lusitanians used butter instead of oil;
he mentions the same circumstance respecting the Ethiopians;
and he relates in another place, that elephants, when wounded,
drank this substance in order to make the darts fall from their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">503</a></span>
<span class="locked">bodies<a name="FNanchor_1555" id="FNanchor_1555" href="#Footnote_1555" class="fnanchor">1555</a></span>. I am much astonished, I confess, to find that the
ancient Ethiopians were acquainted with butter, though it is
confirmed by <span class="locked">Ludolfus<a name="FNanchor_1556" id="FNanchor_1556" href="#Footnote_1556" class="fnanchor">1556</a></span>. It ought to be remarked also, that
according to Aristotle, the elephants, to cure themselves, did not
drink butter, but <span class="locked">oil<a name="FNanchor_1557" id="FNanchor_1557" href="#Footnote_1557" class="fnanchor">1557</a></span>. In this he is followed by <span class="locked">Pliny<a name="FNanchor_1558" id="FNanchor_1558" href="#Footnote_1558" class="fnanchor">1558</a></span>; and
Ælian says, that for the above purpose these animals used
either the bloom of the olive-tree, or oil <span class="locked">itself<a name="FNanchor_1559" id="FNanchor_1559" href="#Footnote_1559" class="fnanchor">1559</a></span>; but Arrian,
who lived a hundred years after Strabo, and who has related
everything respecting the diseases of the elephant and their
cures, in the same order as that author, has omitted this circumstance
<span class="locked">altogether<a name="FNanchor_1560" id="FNanchor_1560" href="#Footnote_1560" class="fnanchor">1560</a></span>. Is the passage of Strabo, therefore,
genuine? Ælian however says, in another part of his book,
that the Indians anointed the wounds of their elephants with
<span class="locked">butter<a name="FNanchor_1561" id="FNanchor_1561" href="#Footnote_1561" class="fnanchor">1561</a></span>.</p>

<p>We are told by Plutarch, that a Spartan lady paid a visit
to Berenice, the wife of Dejotarus, and that the one smelled
so much of sweet ointment, and the other of butter, that
neither of them could endure the other. Was it customary,
therefore, at that period, for people to perfume themselves
with butter?</p>

<p>Of much more importance are the remarks made by Dioscorides
and Galen on this subject. The former says that
good butter was prepared from the fattest milk, such as that
of sheep or goats, by shaking it in a vessel till the fat was
separated. To this butter he ascribes the same effects, when
used externally, as those produced by our butter at present.
He adds also, and he is the first writer who makes the observation,
that fresh butter might be melted and poured over
pulse and vegetables instead of oil, and that it might be employed
in pastry in the room of other fat substances. A kind
of soot likewise was at that time prepared from butter for external
applications, which was used in curing inflammation of
the eyes and other disorders. For this purpose the butter was
put into a lamp, and when consumed, the lamp was again
filled till the desired quantity of soot was collected in a vessel
placed over it.</p>

<p>Galen, who distinguishes and confirms in a more accurate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">504</a></span>
manner the healing virtues of butter, expressly remarks that
cow’s-milk produces the fattest butter; that butter made from
sheep’s- or goat’s-milk is less rich; and that ass’s-milk yields
the poorest. He expresses his astonishment, therefore, that
Dioscorides should say that butter was made from the milk of
sheep and goats. He assures us that he had seen it made
from cow’s-milk, and that he believes it had thence acquired
its <span class="locked">name<a name="FNanchor_1562" id="FNanchor_1562" href="#Footnote_1562" class="fnanchor">1562</a></span>. “Butter,” says he, “may be very properly employed
for ointments; and when leather is besmeared with
it, the same purpose is answered as when it is rubbed over
with oil. In cold countries, which do not produce oil, butter
is used in the baths; and that it is a real fat may be readily
perceived by its catching fire when poured over burning
<span class="locked">coals<a name="FNanchor_1563" id="FNanchor_1563" href="#Footnote_1563" class="fnanchor">1563</a></span>.” What has been here said is sufficient to show that
butter must have been very little known to, or used by, the
Greeks and Romans in the time of Galen, that is, at the end
of the second century.</p>

<p>The Roman writers who give an account of the ancient
Germans, all relate that they lived principally on milk; but
they disagree in one thing, because many of them tell us that
they used cheese, while others affirm that they were not even
acquainted with the method of preparing <span class="locked">it<a name="FNanchor_1564" id="FNanchor_1564" href="#Footnote_1564" class="fnanchor">1564</a></span>. Pliny, on the
other hand, says that they did not make cheese, but butter,
which they used as a most pleasant kind of food. He ascribes
to them also the invention of it; for it is highly probable that
under the expression “barbarous nations” he meant the people
of Germany: and his description of butter appears to me
so clear, that I do not see how it can be <span class="locked">doubted<a name="FNanchor_1565" id="FNanchor_1565" href="#Footnote_1565" class="fnanchor">1565</a></span>. He very
justly remarks, that, in order to make butter in cold weather,
the milk ought to be warmed, but that in summer this precaution
is not necessary. The vessel employed for making it
seems to have had a great likeness to those used at present;
we are told at least that it was covered, and that in the lid
there were <span class="locked">holes<a name="FNanchor_1566" id="FNanchor_1566" href="#Footnote_1566" class="fnanchor">1566</a></span>. What he says however respecting <i>oxygala</i>
is attended with difficulties; and I am fully persuaded that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">505</a></span>
his words are corrupted, though I find no variations marked
in manuscripts by which this conjecture can be supported.
Having made an attempt by transposing the words to discover
the real sense, I found that I had placed them in the
same order as that in which they had been before arranged
by Dithmar, who, in his annotations on Tacitus, quotes them
in the same manner as I would read them, and with so much
confidence that he does not even hint they were ever read
otherwise. Had we both been critics, this similarity might
have given our conjecture perhaps more authority; but Dithmar
also was a professor of the œconomical <span class="locked">sciences<a name="FNanchor_1567" id="FNanchor_1567" href="#Footnote_1567" class="fnanchor">1567</a></span>.</p>

<p><i>Oxygala</i> was evidently a kind of cheese, the preparation of
which has been best described by <span class="locked">Columella<a name="FNanchor_1568" id="FNanchor_1568" href="#Footnote_1568" class="fnanchor">1568</a></span>. In order to
make it, sweet milk was commonly rendered sour, and the
serum was always separated from it. Of this process Pliny
speaks likewise; but he first mentions under the above name
a kind of cheese formed from the caseous parts which remained
behind in the butter-milk, and which when separated from it
by acids and boiling, were mixed and prepared in various
ways. It must in general have been sourish; for, according
to the account of <span class="locked">Galen<a name="FNanchor_1569" id="FNanchor_1569" href="#Footnote_1569" class="fnanchor">1569</a></span>, it affected the teeth, though he mentions
also another kind of cheese, under the name of <i>caseus
oxygalactium</i><a name="FNanchor_1570" id="FNanchor_1570" href="#Footnote_1570" class="fnanchor">1570</a>, which was perfectly mild. In the <span class="locked">Geoponica<a name="FNanchor_1571" id="FNanchor_1571" href="#Footnote_1571" class="fnanchor">1571</a></span>
directions are given how this cheese may be kept fresh for a
long time. If my reading be adopted, the medicinal effects
spoken of by Pliny are not to be ascribed to the butter, but
to the sour <span class="locked">cheese<a name="FNanchor_1572" id="FNanchor_1572" href="#Footnote_1572" class="fnanchor">1572</a></span>; and physicians undoubtedly will be much
readier to allow them to the latter than to the former. Whether
Tacitus by <i>lac concretum</i>, which he says was the most common
food of the Germans, meant cheese or butter I cannot examine,
as we have no grounds to enable us to determine this
question, respecting which nothing more can be <span class="locked">known<a name="FNanchor_1573" id="FNanchor_1573" href="#Footnote_1573" class="fnanchor">1573</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">506</a></span>
I have now laid before the reader, in chronological order,
every thing that I found in the works of the ancients respecting
butter; and it is certain, from what has been said, that it
is not a Grecian, and much less a Roman invention; but that
the Greeks were made acquainted with it by the Scythians,
the Thracians and the Phrygians, and the Romans by the
people of <span class="locked">Germany<a name="FNanchor_1574" id="FNanchor_1574" href="#Footnote_1574" class="fnanchor">1574</a></span>. It appears also, that when they had
learned the art of making it, they employed it only as an ointment
in their baths, and particularly in medicine. Besides
the proofs already quoted, a passage of <span class="locked">Columella<a name="FNanchor_1575" id="FNanchor_1575" href="#Footnote_1575" class="fnanchor">1575</a></span> deserves
also to be remarked, because that author, and not Pliny, as
Vossius thinks, is the first Latin writer who makes use of the
word <i>butyrum</i>. Pliny recommends it mixed with honey to be
rubbed over children’s gums in order to ease the pain of teething,
and also for ulcers in the <span class="locked">mouth<a name="FNanchor_1576" id="FNanchor_1576" href="#Footnote_1576" class="fnanchor">1576</a></span>. The Romans in general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">507</a></span>
seem to have used butter for anointing the bodies of their
children to render them <span class="locked">pliable<a name="FNanchor_1577" id="FNanchor_1577" href="#Footnote_1577" class="fnanchor">1577</a></span>; and we are told that the
ancient Burgundians besmeared their hair with <span class="locked">it<a name="FNanchor_1578" id="FNanchor_1578" href="#Footnote_1578" class="fnanchor">1578</a></span>. A passage
of Clemens of Alexandria, in which he expressly says
that some burned it in their lamps instead of oil, is likewise
worthy of <span class="locked">attention<a name="FNanchor_1579" id="FNanchor_1579" href="#Footnote_1579" class="fnanchor">1579</a></span>. It is however certain, on the other
hand, that it was used neither by the Greeks nor the Romans
in cookery or the preparation of food, nor was it brought
upon their tables by way of dessert, as at a later period was
the custom. We never find it mentioned by Galen and others
as a food, though they have spoken of it as applicable to other
purposes. No notice is taken of it by Apicius; nor is there
anything said of it in that respect by the authors who treat
on agriculture, though they have given us very particular information
concerning milk, cheese and oil. This, as has been
remarked by other writers, may be easily accounted for, by
the ancients having entirely accustomed themselves to the use
of good oil; and in the like manner butter at present is very
little employed in Italy, Spain, Portugal, and the southern
parts of France, where it is sold in the apothecaries’ shops for
medicinal <span class="locked">purposes<a name="FNanchor_1580" id="FNanchor_1580" href="#Footnote_1580" class="fnanchor">1580</a></span>. It is certain besides, that in warm
countries it is difficult to preserve it for any length of time.</p>

<p>To conclude, I shall offer one remark, which, in my opinion
is entirely new. It appears to me, by the information which
I have here collected from the ancients, that at the period
when these authors wrote, people were not acquainted with the
art of making butter so clean and so firm as that which we
use on our tables. On the contrary, I am fully persuaded
that it was rather in an oily state, and almost liquid. They
all speak of butter as of something fluid. The moderns cut,
knead and spread butter; but the ancients poured it out as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">508</a></span>
one pours out oil. Galen tells us, that, to make soot of butter,
the butter must be poured into a lamp. Had the ancients
used in their lamps hard or solid butter, as our miners use
tallow in the lamps that supply them with light under ground,
they would not have made choice of the expression <i>to pour
out</i>. We are told that the elephants drank butter; and liquid
butter must have been very familiar to the Greek translators
of the Sacred Scriptures, when they could mention it as flowing
in streams. Hecatæus, quoted by Athenæus, calls the
butter with which the Pæonians anointed themselves, oil of
<span class="locked">milk<a name="FNanchor_1581" id="FNanchor_1581" href="#Footnote_1581" class="fnanchor">1581</a></span>. Casaubon observes on this passage, that the author
makes use of these words, because butter was then employed
instead of oil, and spoken of in the like manner, as was the
case with sugar, which was at first considered to be a kind of
honey, because it was equally sweet and could be applied to
the same purposes. Hippocrates, on the like grounds, calls
swine’s seam, swine’s <span class="locked">oil<a name="FNanchor_1582" id="FNanchor_1582" href="#Footnote_1582" class="fnanchor">1582</a></span>. This explanation I should readily
adopt, did not such expressions respecting butter, as one can
apply only to fluid bodies, occur everywhere without exception.
In warm countries, indeed, butter may be always in a
liquid state; but I am of opinion that the ancients in general
did not know by means of kneading, washing and salting, to
render their butter so firm and clean as we have it at present.
On this account it could not be long kept or transported, and
the use of it must have been very much limited.</p>

<p>I shall remark in the last place, that butter appears to have
been extremely scarce in Norway during the ages of paganism;
for we find mention made by historians of a present of butter
which was so large that a man could not carry it, and which
was considered as a very respectable <span class="locked">gift<a name="FNanchor_1583" id="FNanchor_1583" href="#Footnote_1583" class="fnanchor">1583</a></span>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn4"><a name="Footnote_1574" id="Footnote_1574" href="#FNanchor_1574" class="fnanchor">1574</a>  On this account some conjecture, and not without probability, that the
name also <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">βούτυρος</span> or <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">βούτυρον</span> is not originally Greek, but that it may
have been introduced into Greece from some foreign country, along
with the thing which it expresses. Conring, for example, is of opinion that
it is of Scythian extraction. The Grecian and Roman authors, however,
make it to be a Greek word, compounded of <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">βοῦς</span>, an ox or cow, and <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">τυρὸς</span>,
cheese, as we learn from the passages of Galen and Pliny already quoted.
Cheese was known to them much earlier than butter; and it is therefore
possible, that at first they may have considered the latter as a kind of
cheese, as it appears that <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">τυρὸς</span> once signified any coagulated substance.
The first syllable of the word, indeed, one should hardly expect, as the
Greeks used the milk of sheep and goats much earlier than cow’s-milk;
and for this reason Schook conjectures that the first syllable was added, as
usual among the Greeks, to magnify the object, or to express a superior
kind of cheese. Varro De Re Rustica, ii. 5, p. 274, says, “Novi majestatem
boum, et ab his dici pleraque magna, ut <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">βούσυκον</span>, <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">βούπαιδα</span>, <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">βούλιμον</span>,
<span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">βοῶπιν</span>; uvam quoque bumammam;” and we find in Hesychius, “<span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">βούπαις
νέος μέγας· βούπεινα, μέγας λιμὸς· βουφάγος, πολυφάγος</span>.” But this
supposes that the Greeks preferred butter to cheese; whereas they always
considered the former as of less importance, and less proper for use. The
same word being still retained in most languages determines nothing; especially
as the Swedes use the word <i>smor</i>, which is totally different, and which
was the oldest German name, and that most used in the ninth century;
and Lipsius, in an old dictionary of that period, found the word <i>kuosmer</i>
butyrum, the first syllable of which is certainly the word <i>kuh</i>, a cow. See
Lipsii Epist. ad Belgas, cent. iii. 44, and Wormii Litteratura Runica,
cap. 27. These etymological researches, which must always be uncertain,
I shall not carry further; but only remark that, according to Hesychius,
butter, in Cyprus, where I did not expect it, was called <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">ἔλφος</span>, which word
may also be foreign. See Martini Lexic. Philol. art <i>Butyrum</i>, who derives
<span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">ἔλφος</span> from <i>albus</i>.</p></div>

<h2 id="aurum">AURUM FULMINANS.</h2>

<p>If a solution of chloride of gold be precipitated by an excess
of ammonia, a yellow powder will be obtained, which, when
heated, or only bruised, explodes suddenly with a prodigious
report. The force of this aurum fulminans is terrible, and,
in the hands of incautious persons, has often occasioned much
mischief. But, however powerful, it cannot, as some have
imagined, be employed instead of gunpowder, even were not
this impossible on account of the high value of the metal from
which it is made; for explosion does not take place when the
powder is confined. Phænomena of this kind are always of
importance, and afford subject of speculation to the philosopher,
though no immediate use can be made of <span class="locked">them<a name="FNanchor_1584" id="FNanchor_1584" href="#Footnote_1584" class="fnanchor">1584</a></span>. Experiments,
however, have rendered it probable that this powder
may possess some medicinal virtues, and we are assured that
it can be employed in enamel-painting.</p>

<p>He who attempts to trace out the invention of aurum fulminans
is like a person bewildered in a morass, in danger
every moment of being lost. I allude here to the immense
wilderness of the ancient alchemists, or makers of gold; to
wade through which, my patience, though pretty much accustomed
to such labour, is not sufficiently adequate. Those
who know how to appreciate their time will not sacrifice it in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">510</a></span>endeavouring to discover the meaning of books which the authors
themselves did not, in part, understand, or to comprehend
passages in which the writer tells us nothing, or, at any
rate, nothing of importance. I have, however, made my way
through this labyrinth from Spielmann to the works which are
ascribed to Basilius <span class="locked">Valentin<a name="FNanchor_1585" id="FNanchor_1585" href="#Footnote_1585" class="fnanchor">1585</a></span>.</p>

<p>The period when this powder was invented is as uncertain
as the accounts given of its composition. It is however probable
that the discoverer was a German Benedictine monk,
who lived about the year <span class="locked">1413<a name="FNanchor_1586" id="FNanchor_1586" href="#Footnote_1586" class="fnanchor">1586</a></span>; and there is reason to think
that he may have made many useful observations, of which
we are yet ignorant. When new observations have been made
respecting gold, they have always been found afterwards in
the works of Valentin, in a passage which no one before could
understand. Such writings are of no more utility than the
answers of the ancient oracles, which were comprehended when
a knowledge of them was no longer necessary, and which misled
those who supposed that they comprehended them sooner.
But the account of aurum fulminans in Valentin is so uncommonly
intelligible, that it almost seems he either wrote in an
explicit manner without perceiving it, or that the words
escaped from him contrary to his intention. As the work
in which it may be found is scarce, I shall transcribe the <span class="locked">prescription<a name="FNanchor_1587" id="FNanchor_1587" href="#Footnote_1587" class="fnanchor">1587</a></span>:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Take a pound of aqua regia made with sal-ammoniac;
that is, take a pound of good strong aquafortis, and dissolve
in it four ounces of sal-ammoniac, and you will thus obtain a
strong aqua regia, which must be repeatedly distilled and rectified
until no more fæsces remain at the bottom, and until it
becomes quite clear and transparent. Take fine thin gold-leaf,
in the preparation of which antimony has been used; put it
into an alembic; pour aqua regis over it; and let as much of
the gold as possible be dissolved. After the gold is all dissolved,
add to it some <i>oleum tartari</i>, or <i>sal tartari</i> dissolved
in a little spring-water, and it will begin to effervesce. When
the effervescence has ceased, pour some more oil into it; and
do this so often till the dissolved gold falls to the bottom, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">511</a></span>
until no more precipitate is formed, and the aqua regia remains
pure and clear. You must then pour the aqua regia from
the gold calx, and wash it well with water eight or ten times.
When the gold calx is settled, pour off the water, and dry
the calx in the open air when the sun shines, but not over the
fire; for as soon as this powder becomes a little heated or
warm, it explodes, and does much mischief, as it is so powerful
and violent that no man can withstand it. When the
powder has been thus prepared, take strong distilled vinegar
and pour over it; keep it continually over the fire for twenty-four
hours, without stirring it, so that nothing may fall to the
bottom, and it will be again deprived of its power of exploding;
but take great care that no accident happens by carelessness.
Pour off the vinegar, and, having washed the powder,
expose it to dry.”</p>

<p>The latter part of the receipt shows that Valentin had made
experiments in order to discover how aurum fulminans might
be deprived of its power of exploding, and he found that this
could be done by vinegar. It appears from his writings that
he had discovered also that the same thing could be effected
by <span class="locked">sulphur<a name="FNanchor_1588" id="FNanchor_1588" href="#Footnote_1588" class="fnanchor">1588</a></span>.</p>

<p>After the time of Valentin, Crollius, who lived in the last
half of the sixteenth century, seems to have been best acquainted
with this powder, and to have principally made it
<span class="locked">known<a name="FNanchor_1589" id="FNanchor_1589" href="#Footnote_1589" class="fnanchor">1589</a></span>: at any rate his works are referred to by most of the
modern writers. He calls it <i>aurum volatile</i>, and speaks of its
being useful in medicine. The name <i>aurum fulminans</i> was,
as far as I know, first used by <span class="locked">Beguin<a name="FNanchor_1590" id="FNanchor_1590" href="#Footnote_1590" class="fnanchor">1590</a></span>. The method of preparing
it is described by Kircher, who considers it as a thing
uncommon, and who calls it <i>pulvis pyrius aureus</i><a name="FNanchor_1591" id="FNanchor_1591" href="#Footnote_1591" class="fnanchor">1591</a>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn4"><a name="Footnote_1584" id="Footnote_1584" href="#FNanchor_1584" class="fnanchor">1584</a>  [That this and other similar chemical phænomena may be of more
advantage than as affording merely subjects for speculation to the philosopher,
although not immediately applicable to any useful purpose, may
be inferred from the valuable application of fulminating mercury, a somewhat
similar compound to that under consideration. This, at first, as with
fulminating gold at present, was a mere curiosity; it has recently caused
the almost complete substitution of percussion for flint locks in fire-arms,
which in addition to the greater certainty caused by the increased rapidity
of the discharge, œconomises the quantity of powder requisite.
</p>
<p>
Fulminating mercury is made by dissolving mercury in nitric acid and
pouring the solution into warm alcohol. Effervescence ensues. When this
has ceased, the mixture is poured upon a filter, and well-washed with water;
after draining, the filter is expanded upon plated copper or stone-ware,
heated to 212° by steam or hot water. Dr. Ure recommends that the
powder be mixed with a solution of mastic in spirits of turpentine, to cause
attachment. Its extensive use in making percussion-caps is well-known.
It is however a very dangerous substance to experiment with, owing to the
readiness with which it explodes, and has caused many very serious accidents.]</p></div>

<h2 id="garden">GARDEN-FLOWERS.</h2>

<p>Some of the flowers introduced into our gardens, and now
cultivated either on account of their beauty or the pleasantness
of their smell, have been procured from plants which
grew wild, and which have been changed, or, according to
the opinion of florists, improved by the art of the gardener.
The greater part of them however came originally from distant
countries, where they grow, in as great perfection as ours,
without the assistance of man. Though we often find mention
of flowers in the works of the Greeks and the Romans, it
appears that they were contented with those which grew in
their own neighbourhood. I do not remember to have read
that they ever took the trouble to form gardens for the particular
purpose of rearing in them foreign flowers or plants.
But even supposing that I may be mistaken, for I do not pretend
to have examined this subject very minutely, I think I
may with great probability venture to assert, that the modern
taste for flowers came from Persia to Constantinople, and was
imported thence to Europe, for the first time, in the sixteenth
century. At any rate, we find that the greater part of the
productions of our flower-gardens were conveyed to us by
that channel. Clusius and his friends in particular, contributed
very much to excite this taste; and the new plants
brought from both the Indies by the travellers who then continued
still more frequently to visit these countries, tended to
increase it. That period also produced some skilful gardeners,
who carried on a considerable trade with the roots and seeds
of flowers; and these likewise assisted to render it more general.
Among these were John and Vespasian Robin, gardeners
to Henry IV. of France, and Emanuel Sweert, gardener
to the emperor Rodolphus II., from whom the botanists at that
time procured many rarities, as appears from different passages
of their works. As this taste for flowers prevails more
at present than at any former period, a short history of some
of the objects of it may not be disagreeable, perhaps, to many
of my readers.</p>

<p>Simon de Tovar, a Spanish physician, brought the tuberose
to Europe before the year 1594 from the East Indies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">513</a></span>
where it grows wild in Java and Ceylon, and sent some roots
of it to Bernard Paludanus, who first made the flower publicly
known in his Annotations on Linschoten’s <span class="locked">Voyage<a name="FNanchor_1592" id="FNanchor_1592" href="#Footnote_1592" class="fnanchor">1592</a></span>. The
full tuberoses were first procured from seed by one Le
Cour, at Leyden, who kept them scarce for some years, by
destroying the roots, that they might not become <span class="locked">common<a name="FNanchor_1593" id="FNanchor_1593" href="#Footnote_1593" class="fnanchor">1593</a></span>.
The propagation of them in most countries is attended with
difficulties; but in Italy, Sicily and Spain, it requires no trouble;
and at present the Genoese send a great many roots to
England, Holland and Germany. The oldest botanists classed
them among the hyacinths, and the name <i>Polianthes tuberosa</i>
was given them by Linnæus in his Hortus Cliffortianus.</p>

<p>The auricula, <i>Primula auricula</i>, grows wild among the long
moss covered with snow, on the Lower Alps of Switzerland and
<span class="locked">Steyermark<a name="FNanchor_1594" id="FNanchor_1594" href="#Footnote_1594" class="fnanchor">1594</a></span>, whence it was brought to our gardens, where,
by art and accident, it has produced more varieties than any
other species of flower. I do not know who first transplanted
it from its native soil. <span class="locked">Pluche<a name="FNanchor_1595" id="FNanchor_1595" href="#Footnote_1595" class="fnanchor">1595</a></span> says only that some roots
were pulled up by Walloon merchants, and carried to Brussels.
This much, at any rate, is certain, that it was first cultivated
with care by the Flemings, who were very successful
in propagating it. Professor Weismantel, who deserves to be
ranked amongst the principal writers on <span class="locked">flowers<a name="FNanchor_1596" id="FNanchor_1596" href="#Footnote_1596" class="fnanchor">1596</a></span>, says that
the auricula was described and celebrated by Ovid, Pliny and
Columella; but this I much doubt. The botanists even of
the seventeenth century, who searched for plants in the works
of the ancients with great diligence, and who took the liberty
of making very bold assertions, were not able to find any name
that would correspond with the auricula; for the conjecture
of Fabius Columna, that it is the <i>alisma</i> of Dioscorides, is
highly improbable, as that Grecian author extols his plant,
which was fond of water, on account of its medicinal virtues
only. In the time of Clusius, most of the varieties of the auricula
were scarce.</p>

<p>The common fritillary, or chequered lily, <i>Fritillaria Meleagris</i>,
was first observed in some parts of France, Hungary,
Italy, and other warm <span class="locked">countries<a name="FNanchor_1597" id="FNanchor_1597" href="#Footnote_1597" class="fnanchor">1597</a></span>, and introduced into gardens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">514</a></span>
about the middle of the sixteenth century. At first it was
called <i>Lilium variegatum</i>; but Noel Capperon, an apothecary
at Orleans, who collected a great many scarce plants, gave it
the name of <i>Fritillaria</i>, because the red or reddish-brown
spots of the flower form regular squares, much like those of
a chess-board. It was called <i>meleagris</i> by Dodonæus, because
the feathers of that fowl are variegated almost in the
same <span class="locked">manner<a name="FNanchor_1598" id="FNanchor_1598" href="#Footnote_1598" class="fnanchor">1598</a></span>.</p>

<p>The roots of the magnificent crown imperial, <i>Fritillaria imperialis</i>,
were about the middle of the sixteenth century brought
from Persia to Constantinople, and were carried thence to the
emperor’s garden at Vienna, from which they were dispersed
all over Europe. This flower was first known by the Persian
name <i>tusac</i>, until the Italians gave it that of <i>corona imperialis</i><a name="FNanchor_1599" id="FNanchor_1599" href="#Footnote_1599" class="fnanchor">1599</a>,
or crown imperial. I have somewhere read that it has been
imagined that the figure of it is to be found represented on
coins of Herod, and that, on this account, it has been considered
as the lily so much celebrated in the Scripture.</p>

<p>The Persian lily, <i>Fritillaria Persica</i>, which is nearly related
to it, was made known almost about the same time.
The bulbs or roots were brought from Susa to Constantinople,
and for that reason it was formerly called <i>Lilium Susianum</i><a name="FNanchor_1600" id="FNanchor_1600" href="#Footnote_1600" class="fnanchor">1600</a>.</p>

<p>African and French marigolds, <i>Tagetes erecta</i> and <i>patula</i>,
were, according to the account of Dodonæus and others,
brought from Africa to Europe, at the time when the emperor
Charles V. carried his arms against Tunis. This however is
improbable; for these plants are indigenous in South America,
and were known to botanists before that period under the
name of <i>Caryophyllus Indicus</i>, from which is derived the
French appellation <i>œillet d’Inde</i>. Cordus calls them, from
their native country, <i>Tanacetum Peruvianum</i><a name="FNanchor_1601" id="FNanchor_1601" href="#Footnote_1601" class="fnanchor">1601</a>.</p>

<p>Among the most beautiful ornaments of our gardens is the
belladonna lily, <i>Amaryllis formosissima</i>, the flower of which,
composed of six petals, is of a deep-red colour, and in a strong
light, or when the sun shines upon it, has an agreeable yellow
lustre like gold. The first roots of it ever seen in Europe
were procured in 1593, on board a ship which had returned
from South America, by Simon de Tovar, a physician at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">515</a></span>
Seville. In the year following, he sent a description of the
flower to Clusius; and as he had at the same time transmitted
some roots to Bernard Paludanus and count d’Aremberg, the
former sent a dried flower, and the latter an accurate drawing
of it to Clusius, who published it in <span class="locked">1601<a name="FNanchor_1602" id="FNanchor_1602" href="#Footnote_1602" class="fnanchor">1602</a></span>. One of the
Robins gave in 1608 a larger and more correct figure, which
was afterwards copied by Bry, Parkinson, and Rudbeck; but
a complete description, with a good engraving, was published
in 1742, by Linnæus<a name="FNanchor_1603" id="FNanchor_1603" href="#Footnote_1603" class="fnanchor">1603</a>, who in 1737 gave to that genus the
name by which it is known at <span class="locked">present<a name="FNanchor_1604" id="FNanchor_1604" href="#Footnote_1604" class="fnanchor">1604</a></span>. Sweert, Bauhin, and
Rudbeck, are evidently mistaken in assigning the East Indies
as the original country of this plant; and <span class="locked">Broke<a name="FNanchor_1605" id="FNanchor_1605" href="#Footnote_1605" class="fnanchor">1605</a></span>, who was
not a botanist, but only a florist, is equally wrong in making
it a native of the Levant. Tovar received it from South
America, where it was found by Plumier and Barrere, and at
a later period by Thiery de <span class="locked">Menonville<a name="FNanchor_1606" id="FNanchor_1606" href="#Footnote_1606" class="fnanchor">1606</a></span>. At first it was
classed with the narcissus, and it was afterwards called <i>lilio-narcissus</i>,
because its flower resembled that of the lily, and its
roots those of the narcissus. It was named <i>flos Jacobæus</i>,
because some imagined that they discovered in it a likeness to
the badge of the knights of the order of St. James in Spain,
whose founder, in the fourteenth century, could not indeed
have been acquainted with this beautiful amaryllis.</p>

<p>Another species of this genus is the Guernsey lily, <i>Amaryllis
Sarniensis</i>, which in the magnificence of its flower is
not inferior to the former. This plant was brought from
Japan, where it was found by Kæmpfer, and also by <span class="locked">Thunberg<a name="FNanchor_1607" id="FNanchor_1607" href="#Footnote_1607" class="fnanchor">1607</a></span>,
during his travels some years ago in that country. It
was first cultivated in the beginning of the seventeenth century
in the garden of John Morin, at Paris, where it blowed, for
the first time, on the 7th of October 1634. It was then made
known by Jacob Cornutus, under the name of <i>narcissus Japonicus
flore rutilo</i><a name="FNanchor_1608" id="FNanchor_1608" href="#Footnote_1608" class="fnanchor">1608</a>. After this it was again noticed by John <span class="locked">Ray<a name="FNanchor_1609" id="FNanchor_1609" href="#Footnote_1609" class="fnanchor">1609</a></span>,
in 1665, who called it the <i>Guernsey lily</i>, which name it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">516</a></span>
still very properly bears. A ship returning from Japan was
wrecked on the coast of Guernsey, and a number of the bulbs
of this plant, which were on board, being cast on shore, took
root in that sandy soil. As they soon increased and produced
beautiful flowers, they were observed by the inhabitants, and
engaged the attention of Mr. Hatton, the governor’s son, whose
botanical knowledge is highly spoken of by Ray, and who sent
roots of them to several of his friends who were fond of cultivating
curious <span class="locked">plants<a name="FNanchor_1610" id="FNanchor_1610" href="#Footnote_1610" class="fnanchor">1610</a></span>. Of this elegant flower Dr. Douglass
gave a description and figure in a small treatise published in
1725, which is quoted by Linnæus in his Bibliotheca, but not
by Haller.</p>

<p>Of the comprehensive genus <i>Ranunculus</i>, florists, to speak
in a botanical sense, have obtained a thousand different <span class="locked">kinds<a name="FNanchor_1611" id="FNanchor_1611" href="#Footnote_1611" class="fnanchor">1611</a></span>;
for, according to the manner in which they are distinguished
by gardeners, the varieties are infinite and increase almost
every summer, as those with half-full flowers bear seed which
produce plants that from time to time yield new kinds that
exhibit greater or uncommon beauties. The principal part
of them, however, and those most esteemed, were brought to
us from the Levant. Some were carried from that part of the
world so early as in the time of the crusades; but most of
them have been introduced into Europe from Constantinople
since the end of the sixteenth century, particularly the Persian
ranunculus (<i>R. asiaticus</i>, Linn.), the varieties of which, if I am
not mistaken, hold at present the first rank. Clusius describes
both the single and the full flowers as new rarities. This
flower was in the highest repute during the time of Mahomet
IV. His Grand Vizir, Cara Mustapha, well-known by
his hatred against the Christians and the siege of Vienna in
1683, wishing to turn the sultan’s thoughts to some milder
amusement than that of the chase, for which he had a strong
passion, diverted his attention to flowers; and, as he remarked
that the emperor preferred the ranunculus to all others, he
wrote to the different pachas throughout the whole kingdom
to send him seeds or roots of the most beautiful kinds. The
pachas of Candia, Cyprus, Aleppo, and Rhodes paid most
regard to this request; and the elegant flowers which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">517</a></span>
transmitted to court were shut up in the seraglio as unfortunate
offerings to the voluptuousness of the sultan, till some of
them, by the force of money, were at length freed from their
imprisonment. The ambassadors from the European courts
in particular, made it their business to procure roots of as
many kinds as they could, which they sent to their different
sovereigns. Marseilles, which at that period carried on the
greatest trade to the Levant, received on this account these
flowers very early; and a person there, of the name of Malaval,
is said to have contributed very much to disperse them all over
<span class="locked">Europe<a name="FNanchor_1612" id="FNanchor_1612" href="#Footnote_1612" class="fnanchor">1612</a></span>.</p>

<p>[Among the favourites of the present day may be <span class="locked">instanced,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The varied and social Pelargoniums (commonly called geraniums),
which from their capability of living in the confined air
of rooms almost form a part of the household furniture in this
country. They are nearly all members of the Cape of Good
Hope. A large number however of those with which we are
familiar are not distinct species, but mere varieties. Geraniums
were first introduced into this country at the end of the
seventeenth century. Pelargoniums differ from geraniums
principally in the irregularity of their flowers, their shrubby
stems and tubular nectaries. They were first separated by
L’Heritier.</p>

<p>The Dahlia, an universal favourite; its exquisite symmetry,
when perfect, and the size of its flowers rendering it one of
the most beautiful of our garden-plants. It is generally stated
to have been introduced by Lady Holland in 1804; but it was
introduced many years before that period, and was only brought
from Madrid by Lady Holland, who apparently did not know
that it was already in the country. The first species of Dahlia
known to Europeans was <i>D. superflua</i> (<i>variabilis</i>, De C.); it
was discovered in Mexico by Humboldt in 1789, and sent to
Professor Cavanilles, of the Botanic Garden at Madrid, who
named the genus in honour of the Swedish Professor Dahl.
Cavanilles sent a plant of it to the marchioness of Bute. From
this species, nearly all the varieties known in our gardens have
been raised. There are now in England ten or twelve species.
including innumerable varieties.</p>

<p>The Rose, which is one of our oldest favourites, and has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">518</a></span>
been known from time immemorial among the civilized nations
of Europe and Asia. It occurs in almost every country of the
northern hemisphere, both in the Old and New World. It is
not found in South America nor in Australia. The name is
derived from <i>rhos</i>, which signifies red in Armorican, whence
<span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">ῥόδον</span>, Greek, and <i>rosa</i>, Latin. More than one hundred species
have been described, and more than two thousand varieties
may be procured in the nurseries.</p>

<p>And lastly, the Calceolarias, which are natives of South America.
Their great variety has rendered them especial favourites.
They abound in Chili and Peru. The name is derived from
<i>calceolus</i>, from the resemblance of the corolla (coloured part
of the flower) to a slipper. In 1820, half-a-dozen species only
were known in this country. During the next ten or twelve
years, five or six more species were introduced from Chili.
Innumerable hybrids are now raised every year, varying in
colour through every possible shade of crimson, brown, orange,
purple, pink, and yellow: there are one or two of a pure white
colour.]</p>

<h2>Transcribers’ Notes</h2>

<p>Text contains Greek. Equipment that cannot display these characters
may substitute question marks or other placeholders.</p>

<p>Punctuation, hyphenation, and spelling were made consistent when a predominant
preference was found in this book; otherwise they were not changed.
Words spelled differently in quoted text than elsewhere were not changed.</p>

<p>Simple typographical errors were silently corrected, except as
noted below; ambiguous unbalanced quotation marks and hyphens at
the ends of lines were retained, except as noted below.</p>

<p>Text often uses periods where commas might be expected. As the
author’s intent is unknown, all of them have been retained.</p>

<p>The spelling and accent marks of non-English words have been retained
as printed in the original book; some possible or likely errors are
noted below, but not comprehensively.</p>

<p>Footnotes, originally at the bottom of the page, have been renumbered
and moved to the end of each chapter. The footnotes to a footnote
retain their original letter-identifications.</p>

<p>In footnotes, the letter “l.” and the number “1.” look alike, so the
representations of some of them here may be incorrect.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_2">2</a>: “but he produces” was printed as “but he produce,” (with a
comma instead of an “s”); changed here. “produce,” was the last word
on the line, and the last word on the next line was “latters”, which
has been changed here to “latter”.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_34">34</a>: “At present it is cultivated” was printed as “A-present”
with the hyphen at the end of the line; changed here.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_84">84</a>: “Recréations” was printed that way, with just one accented “é”.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_84">84</a>: “de la Congr. de St. Maur,” was printed as “de la de Congr. St.
Maur,” but changed here based on examination of an earlier edition.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_99">99</a>: “of trying to what distance” was printed that way.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_173">173</a>: “They consider the forming the strata” was printed that way.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_177">177</a>: “Lottichii” was imperfectly printed, so the “ii” may be
something else, such as “Lottichius”, which appears on page 324.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_239">239</a>: “recals” was printed that way.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_241">241</a>: The closing quotation mark at the end of the
paragraph ending “be admitted into this association”, appears to
belong after the sentence ending “should not be excluded”.
Later in the same paragraph, “insure his houses” was printed that way.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_295">295</a>: Extraneous closing quotation mark removed at end of poem.</p>

<p>Footnote <a href="#Footnote_1013">1013</a>, referenced on page <a href="#Page_326">326</a>: “Arzneywissenschaft” may be a misprint
for “Arzneiwissenschaft”.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_354">354</a>: Missing closing single-quotation mark for text beginning
“‘Si fanno certi orologii”.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_419">419</a>: “lay old of the wire” was printed that way.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_454">454</a>: Missing closing quotation mark added after “in great quantity at Marseilles.”</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_462">462</a>: Closing quotation mark added after “fall upon the countess.”</p>
